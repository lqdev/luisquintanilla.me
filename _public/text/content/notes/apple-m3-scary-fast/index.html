<p>First off, The Verge always does a great job covering and condensing these events into a short video.</p>

<p>My initial impressions of the anouncement, this is why Apple wins.</p>
<p>I'm excited by the Snapdragon announcement last week. However, as I mentioned in my <a href="/posts/quick-thoughts-snapdragon-summit-2023">post</a>, &quot;the biggest miss from Qualcomm and Windows partners today was not having a lineup of devices ready for purchase&quot;.</p>
<p>That wasn't the case for Apple. Not only did they announce their new chips but they also announced devices which will be available as late as the end of November.</p>
<p>I understand Apple owns the entire process so they can align their chip and device announcements. However, Qualcomm brought out many partners on stage. Unless I missed it, I don't remember seeing any PC announcements that would be ready for purchase within the next 2-3 months.</p>
