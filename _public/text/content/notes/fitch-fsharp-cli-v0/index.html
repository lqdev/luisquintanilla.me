I've been using <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">Neofetch</a> on my PC to display system information whenever the terminal opens. However, in some cases, that would hang and it would take a while before I was able to use my terminal.</p>
<p>I then ran into <a href="https://github.com/unxsh/nitch">Nitch</a> which is simple and fast. However, it was missing the local and public IP information Neofetch provides out of the box. Nitch is written using the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> programming language. Originally, I had planned on extending Nitch and I figured out the code I needed to write to support IP information. However, my program wouldn't build and I was unable to find any information online to unblock myself.</p>
<p>That's when I looked at the existing components in Nitch and found that it was basically just reading files from the <code>/proc</code> and <code>/etc</code> system directories. At that point, I decided to see if I could build my own utility using F#. A couple of hours later and the result was <a href="/github/fitch">Fitch</a>. This works well enough for my needs and in the future, I might publish it as a dotnet global tool to make it easy for others to use.</p>
