Because right now it's not fully automated and I haven't been posting as much, there are gaps.</p>
<p>The process is fairly straightforward. I run a script that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collects all of the previous week's posts</li>
<li>Drafts a note with links to all the posts</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I publish the post.</p>
<p>Given this is mostly automated, I decided it was something I could just create a GitHub Action to do the post generation and publishing on my behalf.</p>
<p>However, there were some issues with the original file generation and formatting that were annoying, but easy enough to fix manually so I never invested time in fixing them.</p>
<p>This morning, I created a few issues describing the features and improvements I wanted to make. Worth noting, I did this from my phone.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/issues/213">#213</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/issues/215">#215</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than working on them though, I assigned them to GitHub Coding Agent and stepped out to grab coffee.</p>
<p>The agent worked on solutions in the background and by the time I got back, I had working solutions. They weren't perfect but with no input from me, it got 90-95% of it right. The rest were minor refinements.</p>
