<p>This Utah defense are the real MVPs. Utah hasn't been able to put together a drive all game. So far I think I've seen 3-4 turnovers. The fact that Northwestern is ONLY up by 7 is shocking.</p>
<p><strong>21:47</strong></p>
<p>Make it make sense. Something must've happened. Maybe injuries or something. This season they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beat Florida</li>
<li>Beat USC</li>
<li>Had a close game against Washington which is now in the playoffs</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet they can't put together a drive. Something doesn't add up.</p>
<p><strong>21:54</strong></p>
<p>Okay. I think I got it. Utah like many of the Pac-12 teams is a passing team. Northwestern is in the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/articles/college-football/2023-college-football-defense-rankings-team-pass-and-rush-stats">top 25 passing defenses</a>. So I guess this is the toughest defense they've faced?</p>
<p><strong>22:01</strong></p>
<p>7-7!</p>

<p><strong>22:16</strong></p>
<p>Armchair quarterbacking, but at 44% 4th down conversions, I don't think you go for it on 4th and 2 in the middle of the field. No matter how well your defense is playing and going against a backup quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>22:25</strong></p>
<p>And there it is. Starting QB came back into the game and had a short field to work with against a tired defense. Offense is going to have to dig deep for Utah.</p>
<p><strong>22:33</strong></p>
<p>That's the game. Bad execution on 4th down again.</p>
