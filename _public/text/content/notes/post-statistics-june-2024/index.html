<ul>
<li>At 51 notes, I'm 10 over last year's total notes.</li>
<li>Responses are healthy. I'm closing in on 200. I wasn't as active the month of May so I'm still shy of last year's mark, but given it's still only halfway through the year, it seems like good progress so far.</li>
<li>Most of my posts continue to be related to AI. While I can believe it, I also think I could be more specific and get more creative with my tags. Given the lead AI has though in terms of tag numbers, it'll be harder for those more fine-grained tags to come through.</li>
<li>I won't use the word struggle, but I have paid less attention to long form posts. There's a few that I have planned for June, so that should help bump those numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I'm happy with the progress and use I'm getting out of the website.</p>
<p>Some things I'd like to work on are simplifying my authoring process. Although github.dev and Codespaces can be convenient, it's a hassle. Authoring content locally reduces some of that friction. However, I'm still bound to my laptop.</p>
<p>As a Day One subscriber, I haven't maximized my subscription. This past week I've started to use it more for bookmarking articles I'm reading. Maybe that's a way that I can bookmark articles when on the go and when I'm ready to reshare them on the website, I can just copy from there.</p>
<p>Something else I can use Day One for are to start longer form blog or note drafts. Then, when I'm ready to do more serious work and publish them, I can continue on my laptop.</p>
