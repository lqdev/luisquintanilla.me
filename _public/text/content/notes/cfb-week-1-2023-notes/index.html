<p>Penn State had a great win. Looking back at a <a href="/notes/psu-future-allar">post from last year</a>, some of my thoughts around the upcoming class were right. Looking at the upcoming schedule it looks well spaced out and if they can stay healthy, they'll have a great season.</p>
<p>Tough losses for LSU and Clemson.</p>
<p>This year I'm trying a new way to experience games: blogs + audio streams.</p>
<p>This past week, although I tuned into the games, I didn't watch any of them on TV. Instead, I tuned into the live audio streams on <a href="https://thevarsitynetwork.com/feed">The Varsity Network</a> and for live discusson, I tuned into the various team blogs / communities provided by <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/">SBNation</a> (fun fact: I learned SB stands for Sports Blogs). For example, <a href="https://www.blackshoediaries.com/">Black Shoe Diaries</a>, the Penn State blog, had a <a href="https://www.blackshoediaries.com/2023/9/2/23855867/penn-state-nittany-lions-football-west-virginia-fourth-quarter-open-thread-bsd">live thread</a> for each of the quarters where site writers and fans got to interact in real-time. Other team blogs had similar threads.</p>
<p>Overall, I thought it was a fun experience, and I'm most likely going to do it again this week.</p>
<p>Games I'm most looking forward to Week 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stanford vs USC</li>
<li>Temple vs Rutgers</li>
<li>Texas vs Alabama</li>
</ul>
