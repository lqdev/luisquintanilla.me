<p>Over the past few days, I've been thinking about different forms of sharing content. With the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/technology/personaltech/tiktok-twitter-facebook-social.html">shifts in social media towards smaller, more private communities</a>, is it possible to get the best of feeds for sharing updates and information but in a smaller more intimate way?</p>
<p>Here's a few of the options I came up with:</p>
<h2>Journals</h2>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/guides/tips-and-tutorials/shared-journals/">Day One Shared Journals</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Made for an audience of one, but other can collaborate on it.</li>
<li>Depending on the interface, looking back at specific days and events that took place is easy to look back on.</li>
<li>May be able to include different forms of media (i.e. audio, video, photos)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>No individual profiles</li>
<li>May require everyone to use the same app / service</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>E-mail</h2>
<p>Examples: Newsletters, Mailing lists</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Almost everyone has an e-mail address.</li>
<li>Built on standard protocols.</li>
<li>Producers can use any app they'd like to compose e-mails.</li>
<li>Consumers can use any app they'd like to read e-mails.</li>
<li>Could use any app / client / service-provider they'd like. (Federated by default)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>Content rendering may differ based on app.</li>
<li>Could add to the noise already present in your e-mail inbox.</li>
<li>No individual accounts / feeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Messaging Apps</h2>
<p>Examples: Discord, Matrix, IRC, Slack, Signal</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Sharing could be done via SMS (though this would limit the content you share).</li>
<li>You could form various sub-groups to sub</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>May require everyone to use the same app / service.</li>
<li>May not have a way to view individual profiles or feeds.</li>
<li>Because conversations are not often grouped by topics, it might be difficult to find conversations, especially older conversations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Private blogs</h2>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://wordpress.com/go/tutorials/private-blog-wordpress-com/">Private WordPress Blog</a>, <a href="https://havenweb.org/">Haven</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Produces can use any tool / service to author and publish posts.</li>
<li>Consumers can access via any browser of their choice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>May have to host your own service.</li>
<li>Consumers may have to create accounts and passwords for each of the private blogs they follow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fediverse</h2>
<p>Examples: Mastodon, PixelFed, PeerTube</p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Familar social media interface.</li>
<li>More availability of apps and services that form part of the Fediverse make it easier for producers and consumers to use what makes the most sense for them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>Limited to the format supported by the app / service (i.e. Pixelfed is for images / video, PeerTube for video, etc.).</li>
<li>May require you to host your own service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>P2P Social Media</h2>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">ScuttleButt</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Could be made for an audience of one but shared with other peers.</li>
<li>Decentralized by default.</li>
<li>Access individual feeds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>Similar to the Fediverse, being exposed to new protocols and technical terms may make onboarding and adoption challenging.</li>
<li>May require you to host your own service.</li>
<li>Protocols haven't been widely adopted so users are limited in the apps / services they can use for this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Forums</h2>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/">NixOS Forum</a>, <a href="https://lemmy.world/">Lemmy</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Could create threads and conversations on various topics</li>
<li>Easy to search and tag content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>Someone would have to host a server</li>
<li>Might not work well for small groups</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>RSS feeds</h2>
<p>This is a variation on the private blog. Except instead of having a website that displays the posts, you just have an RSS feed.</p>
<p>Examples: <a href="https://daverupert.com/2018/01/welcome-to-rss-club/">RSS-Only Club</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros
<ul>
<li>Producers can use any software they'd like to create and publish their RSS feed</li>
<li>Consumers can use any feed reader to access and read content</li>
<li>Everyone could have their own feed, so effectively they'd be like profiles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cons
<ul>
<li>You have to figure out how to produce and host the RSS feed</li>
<li>Can't really control who sees this since the feed is public. Maybe private feeds could help here.</li>
<li>Limited interaction. Users can't comment or reply to items in a feed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is not an exhaustive list of pros and cons, just a few that I thought of. I persoanlly would skew towards e-mail and messaging apps. The main reason at least with e-mail is that everyone is familiar with it and most likely won't have to create separate accounts on various silos to communicate and engage with others. With apps like <a href="https://delta.chat/">DeltaChat</a> you could actualy combine them and get the best of both.</p>
