There's many reasons, some related to the sentiment of <a href="/responses/landlord-of-your-notes">owning vs. renting content</a>. Along the same lines, streaming services and service providers can change the terms of service and you have little to no control over it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)">Westworld</a> is an example of that. One day, HBO decided to pull it from its streaming service and physical copies were the only way you could watch it.</p>
<p>Anyway, on to my most recent experience trying to play a Blu-Ray disc on my PC.</p>
<p>The other day I decided to sit down to watch an episode of Westworld. Usually, I get the DVD version. In this case though, I had the Blu-Ray.</p>
<p>I have an external Blu-Ray player so I thought, &quot;Great! Let me just plug that into my laptop and start the show&quot;.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>What I thought was a simple task, ended up taking me about 20 minutes to figure out and even then I got to a subpar solution.</p>
<p>I prefer playing media either with MPV or VLC.</p>
<p>At first, it wouldn't play so I decided to go online and figure out why. Turns out, that's not supported out of the box and to get it working you need to download an additional DLL and <a href="https://www.easefab.com/resource/play-blu-ray-with-vlc.html">configure a few things in the VLC settings</a>.</p>
<p>I could've gone through that process, but I just wanted to watch a show. There's got to be an easier way.</p>
<p>Next, I turned to the built-in Media Player in Windows. No luck there either.</p>
<p>I ended up going with the <a href="https://www.leawo.com/blu-ray-player/">Leawo Blu-Ray player</a>. Although it's free, you have to deal with pop-ups prompting you to upgrade to the paid version. It works though.</p>
<p>I would prefer to use VLC or the built-in media player but it's unfortunate using them isn't as straightforward. Now that I have some more time, I'll set up VLC so that next time, it can &quot;just work&quot;.</p>
<p>I'll close it out with a question.</p>
<p>How do you watch Blu-Rays on your PC?</p>
