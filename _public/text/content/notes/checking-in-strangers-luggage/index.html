<p>Although I've heard these many times before, this time for some reason there's one that caught my attention and got me thinking. I don't remember the exact words, but basically the gist of it said something like, &quot;If anyone asks you to check in baggage other than your own, do not accept it&quot;.</p>
<p>I barely even want to deal with my own bags. Why would I want to deal with someone else's bag?</p>
<p>I've been trying to visualize scenarios where:</p>
<ol>
<li>Someone would come up to you and ask you to check in THEIR luggage</li>
<li>You would accept</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe in scenarios where you're traveling with friends or family? In the case of family, maybe someone doesn't have a carry-on and if there's an extra bag that's small enough to be considered carry-on they'll &quot;claim&quot; it as their carry-on to not pay the extra fees. Still though, that's not checking it in. I'm just having a hard time seeing it.</p>
<p>Putting this out there ahead of time - no, stranger, I will not check in your bag.</p>
