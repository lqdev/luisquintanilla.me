Having upgraded last year from .NET 6, the process was as smooth as I had expected with no code refactoring required.</p>
<p>When it comes to development environments, for quick status updates like the ones on my <a href="/feed">feed</a> or minor edits, I've been using <a href="/notes/surface-duo-blogging-github-dev">github.dev</a>. However, there's been times where I've needed to run and debug code to confirm that my changes work. This is where I hit some of the limitation of github.dev which means unless I set up a Codespace, I have to save my work and move offline to my PC. Codespaces are great, but given that Codespaces are nice to haves not a requirement for my workflow at this time, it didn't make sense for me to pay for them. That's why I was excited to learn that GitHub is providing up to <a href="https://github.blog/2022-11-10-whats-new-with-codespaces-from-github-universe-2022/">60 hours per month of free Codespace usage</a> to all developers. That's more than enough for me.</p>

<p>By default, Codespace images come preinstalled with the .NET 6 SDK which makes sense considering it's the latest LTS. However, since my static site generator targets .NET 7, I had to configure my Codespace to use .NET 7. This was just as easy as upgrading to .NET 7. All I had to do was provide the .NET 7 SDK Docker image as part of my <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/blob/main/.devcontainer.json">devcontainer.json</a> configuration file. From there, Codespaces takes care of the rest. As a result, I can now run and debug my code all in one place without interrupting my workflow.</p>
