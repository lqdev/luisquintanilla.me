That's how I started listening to <a href="/reviews/making-it-in-america">Making It In America</a>. What I didn't know was that there's a limit to the number of hours you can listen in a given month. I only got as far as chapter 2 and now I have to wait 7 days for my listening hours to be replenished for the month.</p>
<p>As a result, I started building the reading backlog at the local library which is now at an unreasonable 164 books that I probably won't get to. It got that way because I added many of the Best of 2023 recommendations from my local library to my wishlist. I haven't added many of those to my <a href="/library">library page</a> because I don't want to go through the process of manually adding them. I should look into whether there's an automated way of getting that information via APIs or batch download.</p>
<p>Last night I started reading <a href="/reviews/how-to-sell-a-haunted-house">How To Sell A Haunted House</a> and I'm enjoying it so far. The next one on deck is <a href="/reviews/a-city-on-mars">A City on Mars</a>.</p>
