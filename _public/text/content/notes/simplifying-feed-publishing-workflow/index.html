Typically my workflow looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mermaid">flowchart TD
  A[&quot;Scroll through feed reader&quot;] --&gt; B[&quot;Open articles I want to read in a new tab&quot;]
  B --&gt; C[&quot;Read articles&quot;]
  C --&gt; D[&quot;Create a response file to publish on my website&quot;]
  D --&gt; E[&quot;Capture interesting information from the article in the response file&quot;]
  E --&gt; F[&quot;Publish the response&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>The bottleneck I usually find is in the middle steps of creating a response file and capturing the relevant content. This usually happens as I'm reading the article. For a single file, it's not a big deal. Doing it for several can be time consuming, especially with the <a href="/notes/subscribed-to-1042-feeds-newsblur">number of feeds I subscribe to</a>.</p>
<p>There's a few things I think could help here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create one response file and do a daily link dump.</li>
<li>Create a browser extension or system where I can:
<ol>
<li>Highlight text or content on a page</li>
<li>Right-click or use a keyboard shortcut to create an entry for the content I highlighted</li>
<li>Create an entry in a database somewhere which captures the URL of the page I'm looking at.</li>
<li>I enter a few more details like the file name I want to use and response type</li>
<li>When I'm done with my session, I can publish. This will use the database content to compose the content for my response and create a PR</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option is simple but I don't like it because although most of the content I come across is tech related, I prefer having individual articles I can link to with their own tags to make it easier to build relationships.</p>
<p>The second option sounds complex, but it's basically a web highlighting tool. I know there's a few out there already so maybe worth checking out.</p>
<p>I'd prefer to build my own to tailor it specifically to what I want just like my website generator. However, it would mean that I'd have to spend some time thinking about how to implement it.</p>
<p>It'd be a fun project though. Maybe worthwhile experimenting with building an AI agent to help me use the content I captured to nicely format the response.</p>
