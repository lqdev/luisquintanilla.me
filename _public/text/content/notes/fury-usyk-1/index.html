<p>I think the judges did a great job. It was a close fight, but the knockdown won it for Usyk.</p>
<p>The ref did a good job not stopping it in the 9th and giving Fury a chance to come back.</p>
<p>I think Fury clowned around too much in the beginning and didn't hit the gas in the middle rounds letting Usyk come back in the later rounds. The clowning probably was masking because Usyk is most likely the best fighter he's fought in his career.</p>
<p>Great job by both fighters coming back, Usyk in those middle rounds and Fury from the knockdock where it looked like he was done.</p>
<p>Also, it's business and most likely both fighters carried each other rather than press the action because this leaves the door open for the rematch.</p>
<p>I doubt Usyk does the trilogy with Anthony Joshua given the series is 2-0. The next fight for both will probably be the rematch.</p>
