I have several Windows 10 devices, but needed a Linux system while on the go. I had given my HP Chromebook a try using Crouton. This worked okay. However, I was limited by the specs of the Chromebook and wanted something with more power for development purposes. Therefore, I erased Windows 10 on the ProBook and installed Ubuntu. The PC worked well. My only problem with it was that I found my battery meter was inaccurate and would reach a percentage in the 60’s before suddenly dropping to zero and shutting down. This was not something I could have, especially during the middle of a work session where I might lose some/all of my work.</p>
<p>Immediately, I assumed it had something to do with drivers/BIOS being out of date. To my surprise, BIOS updates were only available for Windows. Fortunately, through some research I was able to find a solution that allowed me to update my BIOS and fix my battery problems.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure PC is connected to the charger</li>
<li>4GB USB Drive</li>
</ol>
<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Format USB drive. (FAT32 required)</li>
<li>Create folder inside USB drive called Hewlett-Packard\BIOS\New</li>
<li>Download latest BIOS .exe file from HP Support website</li>
<li>Unzip .exe file. While 7Zip is not required, I found this to work well.</li>
<li>Copy .bin file to Hewlett-Packard\BIOS\New folder</li>
<li>Copy entire BIOSUpdate folder to Hewlett-Packard folder.</li>
<li>Restart PC</li>
<li>Continuously press F10 to enter BIOS Setup</li>
<li>Select Update System BIOS menu option</li>
<li>Select Update BIOS Using Local Media option</li>
<li>Select Accept</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the installation process will take effect and the PC will restart itself at which point the your BIOS should be up to date.</p>
