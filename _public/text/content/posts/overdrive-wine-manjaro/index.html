<p>For the last few months, Manjaro has been the operating system I use as my daily driver for personal tasks. I still have my Surface Go tablet which runs Windows 10 that I use for tasks line syncing my Garmin watch and GPS. On one of the <a href="/notes/ipod-touch-discontinued">posts in my feed</a>, I briefly mentioned my audio solution for podcasts and audiobooks which mainly consists of a standalone MP3 player (<a href="https://fiio.com/m6">FiiO M6</a>).</p>
<p>For podcasts, I manage them through my <a href="https://newsblur.com/">NewsBlur RSS feed reader</a>. When I want to download them for offline listening, I've written a .NET console app (<a href="https://github.com/lqdev/podnet">podnet</a>) to manage that process for me. Audiobooks are a little trickier. Public domain works I get through <a href="https://librivox.org/">Librivox</a>. The limitation there though is that I'm only public domain works are available. Therefore if I want other audiobooks, I either have to purchase them (which has its own issues because of DRM) or borrow them from my local library. I prefer to borrow my books and audiobooks from the library. Not only am I supporting my local library but I also save money in the process.</p>
<p>Many libraries including my own manage digital assets through <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/">OverDrive</a>. OverDrive offers a variety of ways for transferring books and audiobooks to your devices. Linux however is not one of those solutions. Until February 2022, OverDrive provided a Windows desktop application (OverDrive Media Console) for managing books and audiobooks. Although there is no Linux desktop application, Linux has Wine. <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> according to their website is &quot;...a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, &amp; BSD.&quot;.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll show how you can use Wine to install OverDrive Media Console on a PC running the Manjaro Linux distribution.</p>
<h2>Install Wine</h2>
<p>In order to install OverDrive Media Console, you'll need to install Wine. To do so:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the terminal.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Install Wine and all its dependencies with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo pacman -S wine winetricks wine-mono wine_gecko
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Install OverDrive Media Console</h2>
<p>The next step is to install the OverDrive Media Console application for Windows desktop.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download the latest version of <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/overdrive./">OverDrive Media Console for Windows Desktop application</a>. This should be a Microsoft Installer file with the <code>.msi</code> extension. Note that as of February 2022, the desktop application is <a href="https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0733.html?tocpath=Home%7CGet%20help%20with%20the%20OverDrive%20app%7CWindows%20(desktop)%7C_____7">no longer available for install</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open the terminal and use Wine to install OverDrive Media Console with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">wine msiexec /i ODMediaConsoleSetup.msi
</code></pre>
<p>Update the name of the <code>.msi</code> file as needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Run OverDrive Media Console</h2>
<p>Once the installation is complete, OverDrive Media Console should be in your list of applications. Run it as you would any other app.</p>
