<p>I'm happy to see more people choosing to have a place that gives them more autonomy and freedom to express themselves in whichever form makes the most sense for them.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Your site is a home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Eventually, social networks were created...novelty and the promise of interconnectedness by gathering in a common town square to blast out whatever was going on in our lives eventually won out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But you might have still had your website, your home to return to...the place you built.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Things started to change and instead of going home, you, and everybody else started to live in the town square.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>There is a shape to your physical home. Arranged and organized in the ways that make sense for you, the reward is a space that works for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A platform or network doesn’t allow for much configuration. The town square isn’t owned by you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>People became absolutely reliant on the same gathering place...the convenience of seeing friends (sometimes) outweighed your other neighbors spouting garbage and hate. You came to rely on this place for everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You can still have a home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I have very little at the town square, because it’s not a public one. It’s a walled-off town square, whose rules and borders change at the whims of those who created it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Thanks for visiting my home. I’m glad you dropped by.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I’d love to see yours sometime.</p>
