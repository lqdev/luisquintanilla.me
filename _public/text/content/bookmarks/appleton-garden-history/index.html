<p>The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments...But streams only surface the Zeitgeisty ideas of the last 24 hours...Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time...The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.</p>

<p>The Six Patterns of Gardening:</p>
<ol>
<li>Topography over Timelines - Gardens are organised around contextual relationships and associative links; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.</li>
<li>Continuous Growth - Gardens are never finished, they're constantly growing, evolving, and changing.</li>
<li>Imperfection &amp; Learning in Public - Gardens are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.</li>
<li>Playful, Personal, and Experimental - Gardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants.</li>
<li>Intercropping &amp; Content Diversity - Gardens are not just a collection of interlinked words...Podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden.</li>
<li>Independent Ownership - Gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control... If you give it a bit of forethought, you can build your garden in a way that makes it easy to transfer and adapt. Platforms and technologies will inevitably change. Using old-school, reliable, and widely used web native formats like HTML/CSS is a safe bet.</li>
