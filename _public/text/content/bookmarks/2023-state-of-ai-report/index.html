<p>Key themes in the 2023 Report include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPT-4 is the master of all it surveys (for now)</strong>, beating every other LLM on both classic benchmarks and exams designed to evaluate humans, validating the power of proprietary architectures and reinforcement learning from human feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Efforts are growing to try to clone or surpass proprietary performance</strong>, through smaller models, better datasets, and longer context. These could gain new urgency, amid concerns that human-generated data may only be able to sustain AI scaling trends for a few more years.</li>
<li><strong>LLMs and diffusion models continue to drive real-world breakthroughs</strong>, especially in the life sciences, with meaningful steps forward in both molecular biology and drug discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Compute is the new oil</strong>, with NVIDIA printing record earnings and startups wielding their GPUs as a competitive edge. As the US tightens its restrictions on trade restrictions on China and mobilizes its allies in the chip wars, NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD have started to sell export-control proof chips at scale.</li>
<li><strong>GenAI saves the VC world</strong>, as amid a slump in tech valuations, AI startups focused on generative AI applications (including video, text, and coding), raised over $18 billion from VC and corporate investors.</li>
<li><strong>The safety debate has exploded into the mainstream</strong>, prompting action from governments and regulators around the world. However, this flurry of activity conceals profound divisions within the AI community and a lack of concrete progress towards global governance, as governments around the world pursue conflicting approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Challenges mount in evaluating state of the art models</strong>, as standard LLMs often struggle with robustness. Considering the stakes, as “vibes-based” approach isn’t good enough.</li>
</ul>
