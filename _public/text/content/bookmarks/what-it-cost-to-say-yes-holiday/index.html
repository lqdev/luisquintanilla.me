<p>Makers...need to have large blocks of uninterrupted, unscheduled time to do what they do. To create and think.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I keep a maker’s schedule because I believe that anything else is anathema to deep work or creativity.</p>

<p>Seneca writes that if all the geniuses in history were to get together, none would be able explain our baffling relationship with time. He says,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>No person would give up even an inch of their estate, and the slightest dispute with a neighbor can mean hell to pay; yet we easily let others encroach on our lives—worse, we often pave the way for those who will take it over. No person hands out their money to passers-by, but to how many do each of us hand out our lives! We’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we should all be the toughest misers.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Time? Time is our most irreplaceable asset—we cannot buy more of it. We cannot get a second of it back. We can only hope to waste as little as possible. Yet somehow we treat it as most renewable of all resources.</p>
