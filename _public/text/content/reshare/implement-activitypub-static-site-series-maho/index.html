<p>As I think about what I want out of my website and the way I engage in the Fediverse, there's a lot of overlap.</p>
<p>Today, what I mainly use my Mastodon instance for is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Having a Fediverse presence on a self-hosted Mastodon instance.</li>
<li><a href="/posts/rss-to-mastodon-posse-azure-logic-apps/">Cross-posting posts on by website using the POSSE pattern</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although I have learned a ton from self-hosting my own Mastodon instance, neither of the points listed above require me self-hosting or even having an account on someone else's instance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="/notes/using-domain-mastodon-discovery">I took the first step in linking my Fediverse presence to my domain</a>. That fulfills my first requirement.</p>
<p>I rarely post original content on Mastodon and for consumption, <a href="/notes/subscribed-to-1042-feeds-newsblur">I already subscribe to accounts and tags via RSS</a>. Therefore, the second requirement is one that can naturally occur without having to use a Mastodon instance as an intermediary. I can just post on my website and because my posts can show up in my outbox, there's no need to POSSE. I don't want my presence to be limited to Mastodon though, but since I plan on supporting media, reviews, and other types of posts, I expect my posts to be accessible across other platforms on the Fediverse like Pixelfed, Bookwyrm, and many others.</p>
<p>Since my website and website features are built using .NET, Maho's guide simplifies my implementation. Because <a href="/colophon">I'm not using any of the existing static site generators and rolled my own</a>, that means that there's going to be some effort and customizations required on my end. It would no different from my <a href="/posts/receive-webmentions-fsharp-az-functions-fsadvent/">custom Webmentions implementation</a> though. My hope is that I will save time I often spend maintaining the server as well as money since I no longer need to rent a server to host my instance. At the same time, I get to learn and contribute to building a more open, decentralized, and personal web.</p>
