<p>But what is the scale of this surveillance? Judging from data collected by Facebook and <a href="https://innovation.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CR_Who-Shares-Your-Information-With-Facebook.pdf">newly described in a unique study</a> by non-profit consumer watchdog Consumer Reports, it’s massive, and examining the data may leave you with more questions than answers.</p>

On average, each participant in the study had their data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied significantly, with some panelists’ data listing over 7,000 companies providing their data.</p>

Events can include visiting a page on a company’s website, leveling up in a game, visiting a physical store, or purchasing a product...
