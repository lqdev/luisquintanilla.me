<p>I have half-jokingly been entertaining an idea of building a new blog: for every blog post published, you get to add one new feature. The first blog post needs to be written in a plain txt file and deployed as-is to a server. With the second post, you can choose to add something you want: maybe a bit of HTML navigation to be able to have links between the blog posts. The third post could come with Markdown support so your posts are not plain text anymore but rendered into HTML. And so on.<br />
<br>
The idea would is that you get to “earn” feature development by writing blog posts. If you want a fancy site with bells and whistles and good tooling, you have to write and publish a lot. That way, you cannot get lost into the rabbit hole of new shiny feature development at the expense of writing.</p>

<p>I like this suggestion. My rewrite has been ongoing but slow. I tried vibe-coding my way to success but didn't have much luck there, so it's taking more time to do it manually. If I was doing it from scratch it wouldn't be a challenge. The challenge is making all the posts and current structure fit into what I want to website to eventually look like.</p>

<p>I use different tools for writing and coding. I can write my blog posts on my iPad when I’m in the library or local pub and at that time, there’s no way for me to tinker with the tools or the website itself.</p>

<p>Another great suggestion. A lot of my desire to rewrite stems from frictions in my current workflow as well as being able to support new and different post types. Back when I had my <a href="/notes/surface-duo-blogging-github-dev">Duo</a>, I didn't mind the mobile VS Code authoring experience, but now that I'm back to a single screen device, not being able to publish from my phone creates a lot of friction.</p>
