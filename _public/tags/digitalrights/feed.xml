      <title>EFF Presents - The Encryptids - Bigfoot</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[star] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m proud to share the first post in a series from our friends, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/Encryptids"&gt;The Encryptids&lt;/a&gt;—the rarely-seen enigmas who inspire campfire lore. But this time, they’re spilling secrets about how they survive this ever-digital world. We begin by checking in with the legendary Bigfoot de la Sasquatch...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People say I'm the most famous of The Encryptids, but sometimes I don't want the spotlight. They all want a piece of me: exes, ad trackers, scammers, even the government. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but my digital profile is worth cash (to skeezy data brokers). I can’t hit a city block without being captured by doorbell cameras, CCTV, license plate readers, and a maze of street-level surveillance. It can make you want to give up on privacy altogether. Honey, no. Why should you have to hole up in some dank, busted forest for freedom and respect? You don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy isn't about hiding. It's about revealing what you want to who you want on your terms. It's your basic right to dignity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
