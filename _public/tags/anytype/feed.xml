      <title>Time to try Anytype</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Currently I'm using org-mode in Emacs for note-taking, journaling, habit-tracking, task management, any many other things. I've heard good things about Notion and Obsidian but haven't made the switch because I like the flexibility of Emacs. I learned about &lt;a href="https://anytype.io/"&gt;Anytype&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago and it looked like it might be a good replacement. I'd been holding out because back then it didn't have local-only mode. In their latest release, they &lt;a href="https://github.com/anyproto/roadmap/issues/34"&gt;added local-only mode&lt;/a&gt; so maybe it's finally time to try it. First though, I have to figure out if it works on NixOS.&lt;/p&gt;
