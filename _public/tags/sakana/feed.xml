      <title>The Darwin Gödel Machine - AI that improves itself by rewriting its own code</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A longstanding goal of AI research has been the creation of AI that can learn indefinitely. One tantalizing path toward that goal is an AI that improves itself by rewriting its own code, including any code responsible for learning. That idea, known as a Gödel Machine, proposed by Jürgen Schmidhuber decades ago, is a hypothetical self-improving AI. It optimally solves problems by recursively rewriting its own code when it can mathematically prove a better strategy, making it a key concept in meta-learning or “learning to learn.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While the theoretical Gödel Machine promised provably beneficial self-modifications, its realization relied on an impractical assumption: that the AI could mathematically prove that a proposed change in its own code would yield a net improvement before adopting it. We, in collaboration with Jeff Clune’s lab at UBC, propose something more feasible: a system that harnesses the principles of open-ended algorithms like Darwinian evolution to search for improvements that empirically improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call the result the Darwin Gödel Machine (full technical report). DGMs leverage foundation models to propose code improvements, and use recent innovations in open-ended algorithms to search for a growing library of diverse, high-quality AI agents. Our experiments show that DGMs improve themselves the more compute they are provided. In line with the clear trend that AI systems that rely on learning ultimately outperform those designed by hand, there is a potential that DGMs could soon outperform hand-designed AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
