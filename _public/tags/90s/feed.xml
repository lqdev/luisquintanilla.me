      <title>Remembering the 90's Video Store</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;p&gt;Reading this post and attached image brings back so many memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember in the last few years of Blockbuster and early days of Netflix, for about $20/month you could rent unlimited movies (I think it was up to three at a time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you binge watched them or weren't happy with the choices you made, you could just drive down to your local store, return them, and grab a new set of movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially you had a return period, but towards the end, there were none so you basically got to keep some movies as long as you liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good times.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SerenityOS</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graphical Unix-like operating system for desktop computers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerenityOS is a love letter to '90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
