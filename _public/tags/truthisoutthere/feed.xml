      <title>Need to automate seasonal 'blue ckecks'</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/july-checkmark.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Profile header image with alien emoji" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really need to automate my website updates. I had forgotten to update the &amp;quot;checkmark&amp;quot; (for lack of better words) for the month of July. Usually, I try to have an icon show up as my &amp;quot;blue check&amp;quot; (Twitter inspired) that is relevant for each month. July is &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Roswell-incident"&gt;Roswell&lt;/a&gt; month mostly because I think I already used the sun emoji for one of the other summer months. I guess being in the US, the US flag would've made sense here, but somehow aliens seemed more fun. Anyway, I need to find a good way to automate this so it's not one of those things that happen when I remember. Since I just changed to the alien emoji, it means I probably will only have it up for a week. August is Tux month because of Linux (again, sun and aliens were already taken). Recommendations are appreciated. Though I'm excited for spooky season in September &amp;amp; October.&lt;/p&gt;
