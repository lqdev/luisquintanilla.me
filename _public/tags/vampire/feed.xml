      <title>Vampire's Kiss (1988)</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnoSxO_2ghQ" title="Vampire's Kiss Movie Trailer"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/PnoSxO_2ghQ/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Vampire's Kiss Movie Trailer" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what I just watched, but I liked it. I thought Nicolas Cage making weird movies was a relatively recent thing, but I guess it goes way back to the 80s. I kept getting thrown off by his accent, which I only noticed about a quarter into the movie and even later into the movie sometimes it wasn't there. His descent and transformation into &amp;quot;Nosferatu&amp;quot; was interesting to watch. Mostly funny, but sometimes just weird and disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested, it's currently &lt;a href="https://tubitv.com/movies/674418/vampire-s-kiss"&gt;streaming for free on Tubi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
