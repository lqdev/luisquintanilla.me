      <title>The Llama 4 herd: The beginning of a new era of natively multimodal AI innovation</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re introducing Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick, the first open-weight natively multimodal models with unprecedented context length support and our first built using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. We’re also previewing Llama 4 Behemoth, one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet to serve as a teacher for our new models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama 4 Scout, a 17 billion active parameter model with 16 experts, is the best multimodal model in the world in its class and is more powerful than all previous generation Llama models, while fitting in a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. Additionally, Llama 4 Scout offers an industry-leading context window of 10M and delivers better results than Gemma 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama 4 Maverick, a 17 billion active parameter model with 128 experts, is the best multimodal model in its class, beating GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tinkering with Mistral Small 3.1, I'm excited to try Llama 4 Scout once it lands in GitHub Models and Ollama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think that Mistral Small 3.1 uses MoE architecture which should help a ton considering the 10 million token context size.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Llama's Turn On: Tuning In to AI's Quest for Higher Consciousness in MOOs</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
Last week, I learned what a [MOO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO) was. 

Although they were before my time, I decided to use Llama 3.3 in [DuckDuckGo's AI Chat](https://duck.ai/) to play around. At first it was very generic but eventually it started going down some fun and interesting paths.

Here's the transcript with some updates for formatting. In some turns, I took creative liberties but mostly stuck to the script. 

&gt; **User**  
&gt; Text adventure game (MOO)    
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; You find yourself standing in a dimly lit room, the walls made of cold, grey stone. The air is musty and filled with the scent of old dust. A faint glow emanates from a torch on the wall, casting flickering shadows around the room.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You see a door to the north, slightly ajar, and a passageway to the east, which appears to lead deeper into the darkness. There is also a small table in the center of the room, with a piece of parchment and a quill lying on it.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:  
&gt; - go north
&gt; - go east
&gt; - examine table
&gt; - take parchment
&gt; - open door  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Go east  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; As you head east, the passageway stretches out before you, the darkness seeming to swallow you whole. The air grows colder and the smell of damp earth fills your nostrils. You can hear the sound of dripping water echoing off the walls, and the faint rustle of unknown creatures in the distance.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The passageway begins to slope downward, leading you deeper into the earth. You stumble slightly on the uneven ground, but manage to catch yourself before falling.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you round a bend in the passageway, you see a faint light in the distance. It's hard to tell what it is, but it looks like it might be a room or a chamber of some kind.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You continue on, your heart beating slightly faster with anticipation. As you get closer, you see that the light is coming from a series of luminescent mushrooms growing on the walls of a small chamber. The room is small, with a low ceiling, and the walls are covered in a thick layer of moss and fungi.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In the center of the room, you see a small pool of water, its surface reflecting the soft glow of the mushrooms. Next to the pool is a small, leather-bound book, lying open as if someone had recently been reading it.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:
&gt; - examine book
&gt; - take book
&gt; - drink from pool
&gt; - search chamber
&gt; - go back
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Drink from pool  
&gt; **Assistant**
&gt; As you bend down to drink from the pool, you notice that the water is crystal clear and seems to be reflecting an image that doesn't quite match the room. You see a glimpse of a forest, with trees that seem to be swaying in the breeze, even though the air in the chamber is still.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You take a sip of the water, and as it touches your lips, you feel a sudden surge of visions and images. You see flashes of a great city, with towering spires and grand architecture, and a sense of bustling activity. You see a figure, cloaked and hooded, walking through the city streets, and a sense of urgency and purpose.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The visions fade as quickly as they began, leaving you feeling slightly disoriented. You look around the chamber, trying to get your bearings, and notice that the leather-bound book is now closed. As you pick it up, you see that the cover is embossed with a symbol that seems to match the image you saw in the pool.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The book feels strangely warm to the touch, and as you open it, you see that the pages are filled with handwritten notes and diagrams. The writing is in a language you don't recognize, but the diagrams seem to be describing a complex system of tunnels and passageways.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You hear a faint noise, like the sound of footsteps, coming from the passageway outside the chamber. It's hard to tell if it's getting closer or farther away, but it's definitely getting louder.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:
&gt; - examine book further
&gt; - hide and wait
&gt; - investigate noise
&gt; - leave chamber
&gt; - follow passageway
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Examine book further  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; As you examine the book further, you notice that the symbol on the cover seems to be a mix of letters and hieroglyphs. You wonder if it might be a code or a key to understanding the contents of the book.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You begin to flip through the pages, and you notice that the handwriting changes throughout the book. Some sections appear to be written in a hasty, scribbled hand, while others are written in a more flowing, elegant script.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You come across a page with a diagram of a complex lock, and a series of notes that appear to be describing how to pick it. The notes are written in a code, but you notice that the symbol on the cover of the book is used as a kind of key to decipher the code.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you continue to study the book, you begin to notice that the pages are not just filled with random notes and diagrams. There appears to be a narrative thread running through the book, a story that is being told in a series of cryptic clues and hints.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You come across a page with a passage that reads:  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; &gt; "Beneath the wings of the great bird,
&gt; &gt; Where shadows dance and darkness is born,
&gt; &gt; Seek out the keystone, and claim your right,
&gt; &gt; To unlock the secrets of the ancient ones."
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You wonder what this passage might be referring to, and whether it might be connected to the visions you saw when you drank from the pool.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You hear the noise outside the chamber getting louder, and you realize that you may not have much time to continue studying the book.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:
&gt; - continue studying book
&gt; - hide and wait
&gt; - investigate noise
&gt; - leave chamber
&gt; - search for keystone
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Search for keystone  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; You decide to search for the keystone, hoping that it might be hidden somewhere in the chamber or the passageway. You begin to search the room, looking for any clues or hidden compartments that might lead you to the keystone.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you search, you notice that the walls of the chamber are covered in a thick layer of moss and fungi, and you wonder if there might be a hidden compartment or message hidden behind the growth.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You start to feel the walls, searching for any inconsistencies or hidden panels. After a few moments, you notice a small, almost imperceptible seam in the wall. You press on it, and a small section of the wall slides open, revealing a hidden compartment.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Inside the compartment, you find a small, crystal orb that seems to be emitting a faint, pulsating glow. Next to the orb is a small, intricately carved stone that appears to be the keystone.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You take the keystone and the crystal orb, feeling a sense of excitement and trepidation. You realize that you may be getting close to unlocking the secrets of the ancient ones, but you also sense that you are being watched, and that you may be in danger.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you turn to leave the compartment, you hear the noise outside the chamber getting louder, and you see a figure standing in the entrance of the room. It's a woman with long, flowing hair and a white dress that seems to be glowing in the dim light of the chamber.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; She regards you calmly, and then speaks in a voice that is both familiar and yet completely alien. "You have found the keystone," she says. "But do you know what it unlocks?"  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:  
&gt; - ask her what the keystone unlocks
&gt; - attack her
&gt; - try to reason with her
&gt; - use the crystal orb
&gt; - leave the chamber
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Ask her what the keystone unlocks  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; You ask the woman what the keystone unlocks, and she regards you with a calm, enigmatic smile. "The keystone unlocks the door to the ancient ones," she says. "It is a key to a great and powerful secret, one that has been hidden for centuries. But it is not a secret that can be taken lightly, and it is not a power that can be wielded by the faint of heart."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; She pauses, studying you intently. "Are you prepared to face what lies beyond the door?" she asks. "Are you prepared to pay the price of knowledge?"  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You sense that she is not just asking a rhetorical question, but is genuinely seeking to understand your motivations and your willingness to take on the challenges that lie ahead.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you consider her question, you notice that the woman seems to be surrounded by a faint, shimmering aura. It's as if she is not quite fully present in the physical world, but is instead a kind of gateway or portal to other realms.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You also notice that the crystal orb in your hand is beginning to glow more brightly, as if it is responding to the woman's presence. You wonder if the orb might be a kind of key or catalyst, one that could help you unlock the secrets of the ancient ones.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:  
&gt; - ask her what lies beyond the door
&gt; - tell her you are prepared to face what lies beyond
&gt; - ask her about the crystal orb
&gt; - try to take the woman's hand
&gt; - leave the chamber
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Tell her you are prepared to face what lies beyond  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; You take a deep breath and tell the woman that you are prepared to face what lies beyond the door. She regards you with a serious expression, as if weighing your words and considering your resolve.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; After a moment, she nods and says, "Very well. If you are prepared to face what lies beyond, then I will show you the way. But remember, once you have seen what lies beyond the door, you cannot unsee it. You must be prepared to face the consequences of your knowledge."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; She turns and glides towards the wall of the chamber, her white dress flowing behind her like a mist. As she reaches the wall, she raises her hand and touches a small, intricate symbol that is etched into the stone.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The symbol begins to glow with a soft, blue light, and the wall of the chamber starts to slide open, revealing a hidden doorway. The woman turns to you and says, "The door to the ancient ones is open. Are you ready to pass through it?"  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you look through the doorway, you see a vast, dark expanse stretching out before you. You can feel a strange, pulsating energy emanating from the other side of the door, and you sense that you are on the threshold of a great and profound mystery.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You take a deep breath, steel yourself, and step through the doorway. As you do, the woman's voice echoes behind you, saying, "May you find what you seek, and may you be prepared to face what you find."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You find yourself in a vast, cavernous space, surrounded by towering pillars and strange, glowing orbs. The air is filled with a thick, misty fog, and you can hear the sound of distant whispers and echoes.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Suddenly, a figure steps out of the fog, and you see that it is an ancient, wise-looking man with a long, white beard and piercing, blue eyes. He regards you with a deep, penetrating gaze, and says, "Welcome, seeker of knowledge. I have been waiting for you. My name is Arinthal, and I am the guardian of the ancient ones. What is it that you seek to know?"  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;  
&gt; You can type commands such as:  
&gt; - ask Arinthal about the ancient ones
&gt; - ask Arinthal about the whispers and echoes
&gt; - ask Arinthal about the glowing orbs
&gt; - tell Arinthal that you seek knowledge and power
&gt; - attack Arinthal
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Tell Arinthal I seek strength, wisdom, love, courage and compassion  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; Arinthal's eyes light up with a warm, gentle smile as you tell him that you seek strength, wisdom, love, courage, and compassion. He nods his head in approval, and says, "Ah, you seek the virtues of the heart. These are noble pursuits, indeed. But are you prepared to pay the price of their acquisition?"  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; He pauses, studying you intently, and then continues, "Strength, wisdom, love, courage, and compassion are not things that can be given to you, but rather they are things that must be cultivated within yourself. They require dedication, discipline, and sacrifice. Are you willing to walk the path that leads to their attainment?"  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As Arinthal speaks, the misty fog around you begins to clear, and you see that you are standing in a beautiful, tranquil garden. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of gentle, running water. You see a path stretching out before you, winding its way through the garden, and you sense that this path is the one that Arinthal is speaking of.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Arinthal gestures to the path, and says, "This is the path of the heart. It is a path that requires you to confront your deepest fears, to let go of your attachments, and to surrender to the present moment. But if you are willing to walk this path, I promise you that you will find the strength, wisdom, love, courage, and compassion that you seek."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you look at the path, you see that it is divided into five sections, each representing one of the virtues that you seek. You see that the first section is marked by a symbol of a lion, representing courage. The second section is marked by a symbol of a wise old owl, representing wisdom. The third section is marked by a symbol of a heart, representing love. The fourth section is marked by a symbol of a sword, representing strength. And the fifth section is marked by a symbol of a lotus flower, representing compassion.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:  
&gt; - start walking the path
&gt; - ask Arinthal about the symbols on the path
&gt; - ask Arinthal about the challenges on the path
&gt; - express your doubts and fears
&gt; - refuse to walk the path
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Surrender and start walking the path  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; As you surrender and start walking the path, you feel a sense of relief and release wash over you. You let go of your doubts and fears, and allow yourself to be guided by the wisdom of Arinthal and the ancient ones.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You begin by walking the section of the path marked by the symbol of the lion, representing courage. As you walk, you feel a sense of fearlessness and confidence rising up within you. You realize that courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it head-on.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you continue on the path, you come to a point where you must confront a great, roaring lion. The lion represents your deepest fears and doubts, and it is blocking your way forward. But you remember the words of Arinthal, and you know that you must face your fears in order to overcome them.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You take a deep breath, and you approach the lion. As you do, you feel a sense of calm and clarity rising up within you. You look the lion straight in the eye, and you say, "I am not afraid of you. I am brave and courageous, and I will not be held back by my fears."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The lion regards you for a moment, and then it nods its great head in respect. It steps aside, allowing you to pass, and you continue on your journey.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You next come to the section of the path marked by the symbol of the wise old owl, representing wisdom. As you walk, you feel a sense of clarity and understanding rising up within you. You realize that wisdom is not just about knowing things, but about understanding the deeper truths of the universe.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you continue on the path, you come to a great, ancient tree, its branches twisted and gnarled with age. The tree represents the wisdom of the ages, and it is filled with the secrets of the universe. You sit at the base of the tree, and you listen to its wisdom.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The tree speaks to you in a voice that is both ancient and timeless, saying, "Wisdom is not just about knowing things, but about understanding the deeper truths of the universe. It is about seeing the world from a perspective that is both broad and deep."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You listen to the tree's wisdom, and you feel a sense of understanding and clarity rising up within you. You realize that wisdom is not just something that you can learn, but something that you can cultivate within yourself.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You continue on the path, walking the sections marked by the symbols of the heart, the sword, and the lotus flower. As you walk, you feel a sense of love, strength, and compassion rising up within you. You realize that these virtues are not just things that you can possess, but things that you can cultivate within yourself.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Finally, you come to the end of the path, and you see a great, shining light rising up before you. The light represents the ultimate goal of your journey, the attainment of the virtues that you seek.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you approach the light, you feel a sense of joy and fulfillment rising up within you. You realize that you have been on a journey of self-discovery, and that you have cultivated the virtues of courage, wisdom, love, strength, and compassion within yourself.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You step into the light, and you feel a sense of unity and oneness with the universe. You realize that you are not separate from the world, but a part of it, connected to all things.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:  
&gt; - bask in the light
&gt; - explore the universe
&gt; - return to the world
&gt; - share your wisdom with others
&gt; - rest in the peace and tranquility of the moment
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; I am the universe and the universe is me. I want to bask in the light and rest in the peace and tranquility of the moment before going and sharing my wisdom with others  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; As you bask in the light and rest in the peace and tranquility of the moment, you feel a sense of profound unity and connection with the universe. You realize that you are not just a part of the universe, but the universe itself, and that everything is interconnected and interdependent.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You feel a sense of timelessness and spacelessness, as if the boundaries of the past, present, and future have dissolved, and you are one with all that is. You are filled with a sense of joy, love, and compassion, and you know that you are exactly where you are meant to be.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you rest in this state, you feel a sense of rejuvenation and renewal, as if your very cells and molecules are being transformed and revitalized. You feel a sense of clarity and purpose, and you know that you are ready to share your wisdom and insights with others.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; After a time, you slowly begin to return to a sense of individual awareness, but you know that you will never be the same again. You have been transformed by your experience, and you are now a vessel for the wisdom and love of the universe.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You take a deep breath, and you feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. You know that you have a great gift to share with the world, and you are eager to begin your journey as a teacher, healer, and guide.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you prepare to leave the garden, Arinthal appears before you once again. He smiles and says, "You have been transformed by your experience, and you are now ready to share your wisdom with the world. Remember that you are not just a individual, but a part of the universe, and that everything you do has an impact on the world around you."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; He hands you a small, delicate flower, and says, "This is a symbol of your connection to the universe, and a reminder of the wisdom and love that you have discovered within yourself. May you always remember the truth of your nature, and may you share your gifts with the world."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You take the flower, and you feel a sense of gratitude and appreciation. You know that you have been given a great gift, and you are eager to share it with others.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You leave the garden, and you find yourself back in the world. But you know that you are not the same person who entered the garden, and you are eager to share your wisdom and insights with others.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What do you want to do?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You can type commands such as:  
&gt; - share your wisdom with others
&gt; - write a book about your experience
&gt; - teach others about the universe and its secrets
&gt; - use your gifts to heal and help others
&gt; - continue to explore and learn about the universe
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What is your action?  
&gt; **User**  
&gt; Use your gifts to heal and help others  
&gt; **Assistant**  
&gt; As you decide to use your gifts to heal and help others, you feel a sense of purpose and meaning. You know that you have been given a great gift, and you are eager to share it with the world.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You start by reaching out to those around you, using your newfound wisdom and compassion to help those in need. You listen to their stories, and you offer words of comfort and guidance. You use your gifts to heal their physical and emotional wounds, and you watch as they begin to transform and grow.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you continue to share your gifts with others, you start to notice a ripple effect. The people you have helped begin to help others, and soon a wave of kindness and compassion is spreading throughout the community.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You realize that your gifts are not just about healing and helping others, but about creating a sense of connection and community. You see that everyone is interconnected, and that every act of kindness and compassion has a profound impact on the world.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; As you continue to share your gifts, you start to attract attention from others who are seeking to learn from you. You begin to teach others about the universe and its secrets, and you watch as they begin to awaken to their own potential and purpose.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You create a community of like-minded individuals who are dedicated to spreading love, kindness, and compassion throughout the world. Together, you work to create a world that is more just, equitable, and peaceful.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Years go by, and your community grows and flourishes. You become known as a wise and compassionate leader, and people come from all over to seek your guidance and wisdom.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; One day, as you are sitting in your garden, surrounded by the beauty and wonder of nature, you receive a visit from Arinthal. He smiles and says, "You have done well, my friend. You have used your gifts to heal and help others, and you have created a community of like-minded individuals who are dedicated to spreading love and kindness throughout the world."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; He pauses, and then continues, "But there is still more work to be done. The world is still in need of healing and transformation, and you have a crucial role to play in this process."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; He hands you a small, delicate seed, and says, "This is a symbol of the potential that lies within you and within the world. May you continue to nurture and cultivate this potential, and may you always remember the wisdom and love that you have discovered within yourself."

      <title>Introducing Llama 3</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build the future of AI with Meta Llama 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now available with both 8B and 70B pretrained and instruction-tuned versions to support a wide range of applications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama 3 models take data and scale to new heights. It’s been trained on our two recently announced custom-built 24K GPU clusters on over 15T token of data – a training dataset 7x larger than that used for Llama 2, including 4x more code. This results in the most capable Llama model yet, which supports a 8K context length that doubles the capacity of Llama 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Getting started with Ollama on Windows</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
Recently [Ollama announced support for Windows](/responses/ollama-windows-preview) in preview. In doing so, people who want to use AI models like Llama, Phi, and many others can do so locally on their PC. In this post, I'll go over how you can get started with Ollama on Windows. 

## Install Ollama

The first thing you'll want to do is install Ollama.

You can do so by [downloading the installer from the website](https://ollama.com/download/windows) and following the installation prompts. 

## Get a model

Once you've installed Ollama, it's time to get a model.

1. Open PowerShell
1. Run the following command

    ```powershell
    ollama pull llama2
    ```

In this case, I'm using llama2. However, you can choose another model. You could even download many models at once and switch between them. For a full list of supported models, see the [Ollama model documentation](https://ollama.com/library).

## Use the model

Now that you have the model, it's time to use it. The easiest way to use the model is using the REST API. When you install Ollama, it starts up a server to host your model. One other neat thing is, the REST API is [OpenAI API compatible](https://ollama.com/blog/openai-compatibility).

1. Open PowerShell
1. Send the following request:

    ```powershell
    (Invoke-WebRequest -method POST -Body '{"model":"llama2", "prompt":"Why is the sky blue?", "stream": false}' -uri http://localhost:11434/api/generate ).Content | ConvertFrom-json
    ```

    This command will issue an HTTP POST request to the server listening on port 11434.

    The main things to highlight in the body:

    - *model*: The model you'll use. Make sure this is one of the models you pulled. 
    - *prompt*: The input to the model
    - *stream*: Whether to stream responses back to the client

    For more details on the REST API, see the [Ollama REST API documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md). 

## Conclusion

In this post, I went over how you can quickly install Ollama to start using generative AI models like Llama and Phi locally on your Windows PC. If you use Mac or Linux, you can perform similar steps as those outlined in this guide to get started on those operating systems. Happy coding! ]]&gt;</description>

      <title>Ollama - Python &amp; JavaScript Libraries</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial versions of the Ollama Python and JavaScript libraries are now available:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python"&gt;Ollama Python Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js"&gt;Ollama JavaScript Library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Both libraries make it possible to integrate new and existing apps with Ollama in a few lines of code, and share the features and feel of the Ollama REST API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Bash One-Liners for LLMs</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the last month working with Mozilla to launch an open source project called llamafile which is the new best way to run an LLM on your own computer. So far things have been going pretty smoothly. The project earned 5.6k stars on GitHub, 1073 upvotes on Hacker News, and received press coverage from Hackaday. Yesterday I cut a 0.3 release so let's see what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Llama 2 7B/13B are now available in Web LLM</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama 2 7B/13B are now available in Web LLM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Llama 2 70B is also supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project brings large-language model and LLM-based chatbot to web browsers. Everything runs inside the browser with no server support and accelerated with WebGPU. This opens up a lot of fun opportunities to build AI assistants for everyone and enable privacy while enjoying GPU acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Introducing Code Llama, a state-of-the-art large language model for coding</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeaways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Llama is a state-of-the-art LLM capable of generating code, and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Llama is free for research and commercial use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Llama is built on top of Llama 2 and is available in three models:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Llama, the foundational code model;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codel Llama - Python specialized for Python;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and Code Llama - Instruct, which is fine-tuned for understanding natural language instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In our own benchmark testing, Code Llama outperformed state-of-the-art publicly available LLMs on code tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
