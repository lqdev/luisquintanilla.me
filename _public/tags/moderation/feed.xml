      <title>Bluesky’s Stackable Approach to Moderation</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluesky was created to put users and communities in control of their social spaces online. The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders. Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re &lt;a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/ozone"&gt;open-sourcing Ozone&lt;/a&gt;, our collaborative moderation tool. With Ozone, individuals and teams can work together to review and label content across the network. Later this week, we’re opening up the ability for you to run your own independent moderation services, seamlessly integrated into the Bluesky app. This means that you'll be able to create and subscribe to additional moderation services on top of what Bluesky requires, giving you unprecedented control over your social media experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
