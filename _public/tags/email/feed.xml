      <title>Proton and Standard Notes are joining forces </title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...today, we’re happy to announce that Standard Notes will also join us to advance our shared mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Proton and Standard Notes share a strong commitment to our communities, so Standard Notes will remain open source, freely available, and fully supported. Prices are not changing, and if you have a current subscription to Standard Notes, it will continue to be honored. Proton aspires to do the right thing and be a responsible home for open-source projects, and just as we did with SimpleLogin, we are committed to preserving what makes Standard Notes special and much loved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the coming months, we hope to find ways to make Standard Notes more easily accessible to the Proton community. This way, in addition to protecting your email, calendar, files, passwords, and online activity, you can also protect your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another exciting acquisition! I mainly use org-mode in Emacs for note taking. However, I love the ecosystem Proton is building with their security and privacy focused set of collaborative software offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What a bunch of A-list celebs taught me about how to use my phone</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[star] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...[phone-free celebs are] not trying to disconnect from everyone, but they are trying to get away from that feeling of being tapped constantly on the shoulder by all the calls, texts, and emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many celebrities ditch their phone, disconnect from their social media, log off entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, Ed Sheeran shared a strategy...He hasn’t had a phone since 2015...Being phoneless hadn’t cut his contact to the world, Sheeran said, just reduced it — and that was the point. “I have friends email and people email, and every few days I’ll sit down and open up my laptop, and I’ll answer 10 emails at a time,” he said. “I’ll send them off, and I close my laptop, and then that’ll be it. And then I’ll go back to living my life, and I don’t feel overwhelmed by it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read and watch enough celebrity interviews, and the lesson becomes obvious: that the most powerful and connected device in your life shouldn’t be within arm’s reach at all times. All that does is invite distraction and makes it too easy to disengage from your life every time you get bored or sad or curious even for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds a little like I’m advocating for the return of the ’90s, when the computer was a giant box that lived in a central room of your home and the only way to use it was to go to it. And to some extent, I am! I’m increasingly convinced that my primary computer should be a device I use on purpose — that I sit down at, operate, and then extract myself from until the next time. Whether it’s a laptop on a desk or an iPad on your nightstand, your computer should be a place as much as it is a device. And when you’re not in that place, you’re somewhere else. The computer doesn’t come along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks, as an experiment, I’ve moved as many apps as possible — the obviously distracting social media stuff but also anything I can live without on a minute-to-minute basis — off my phone and onto my tablet and my laptop...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So far, it’s been great. I’m realizing how much of a crutch my phone really has become: I would open up TikTok just to keep me company on the walk to the kitchen or scroll through Threads while I waited for the microwave to finish. Now, I’m not sure I’m doing any less of those things in aggregate, but at least I’m doing them on purpose. I’ve turned time-wasting into a deliberate activity — I sit in my scrolling chair and scroll away, then I get up, and the scrolling stays put. And best of all, when I leave the house, there’s nothing to scroll at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has always been talk in tech about removing friction: the obsessive corporate desire to make everything easier, faster, fewer clicks, fewer chances for you to decide not to click that ad or buy that thing or like that post or upload that photo...It should be a little harder for someone to distract me while I’m eating dinner with my wife or hanging out with my kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about ditching technology, just about doing technology on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Plain text</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide provides an overview of plain text and how it can be used for a variety of tasks and advantages over rich text and custom text formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is plain text?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, plain text is text that isn't formatted and generally uses common characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of plain text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity: Focus on the content rather than the formatting or medium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portability: Any text editor can create and display plain text. That means you're not locked in to any particular tool or service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local-first: Because you can create plain text files using any phone or computer, it means your files belong to you and you have access to them any time regardless of network connectivity. While you can upload and sync your files with your preferred cloud storage provider for redundancy and backup, it's not a requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longevity: Computers have been able to create and display plain text for decades. Since you don't need proprietary file formats or tools to create and consume plain text, it's likely many decades from now you'll be able to read plain text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional plain markup and text formats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write plain text on its own. However, you can format your plain text to provide additional visual cues, information, and context. Some popular plain formats and markup languages include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html"&gt;Org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latex-project.org/"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Editors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are a few popular plain text editors you can use to read and create plain text files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vim.org/"&gt;vi/vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9msmlrh6lzf3?hl=en-us&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Notepad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note taking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to start taking notes using plain text is to open any text editor of choice and start capturing your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Productivity / Personal Knowledge Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An extension to note taking is personal knowlege management and productivity. Whether it's scheduling appointments, journaling, tracking habits (exercise, reading, meditation), or managing to-do lists, you can use plain text for these tasks. Some tools and formats that can help with that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://orgmode.org/"&gt;Emacs Org Mode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://todotxt.org/"&gt;todo.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While e-mail clients support HTML, in general e-mail communication is predomenantly text-based. Therefore, plain text is all you need. If you wanted to only use plain text, e-mail clients enable you to configure them to only support plain text. While your HTML e-mails may look weird, there are some advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://useplaintext.email/"&gt;use plaintext email guide&lt;/a&gt; can provide guidance as to how to get started using plaintext only for e-mails&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Personal finance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many apps for managing your personal finance. However, if you want to keep it simple, you can track your personal finances using plain text as well. Some tools that can help you do that include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ledger-cli.org/"&gt;Ledger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Databases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think of a database, you might think of a complicated system hosted in a server. While database systems are optimized for enterprise production workloads, at the end of the day, the purpose of a database is to store data. That means plain text can work for that too. Some tools that can help you here include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/recutils/"&gt;GNU Recutils&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blogging and building websites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more capable our computing devices have become, our software has suffered from inflation by becoming larger. However, larger doesn't mean the software is richer. If you're just trying to transmit information, you can upload your raw text files containing your blog posts or website to a server and they can be displayed in the browser. Examples of these sites include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://minim.blog/"&gt;minim.blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://250kb.club/"&gt;250kb club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://512kb.club/"&gt;512kb club&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often you can build these websites with the help of static site generators such as. The &lt;a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/"&gt;Static Site Generators catalog&lt;/a&gt; provides more details on popular ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For hosting, you can do so for free using offerings like GitHub Pages. The &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll"&gt;Setting up a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; can help you get started there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Additional Resources&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Blog instead of e-mail?</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about shifting at least some of my communications from e-mails to blogs especially in the context of business communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogs are pull rather than push, so I'm not innundating other's inboxes. People who are interested in the projects or topics I'm working on can subscribe and consume the content as they wish. Also it's a way to be more expressive since it's a medium where ideas can be connected to provide more relevant context. That doesn't mean chats and even e-mail couldn't be used for urgent communication. For async non-urgent communciation though, blogs might be a good alternative to e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two articles provide a good introduction into how individuals and companies have implemented similar practices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ideaspace.ystrickler.com/p/metablogging"&gt;Metablogging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3017396/is-there-life-after-email-yes-and-its-amazing"&gt;Is There Life After E-mail? Yes, and It's Amazing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
