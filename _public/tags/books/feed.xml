      <title>Building up the reading backlog</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been using Spotify to listen to audiobooks since it's included as part of their Premium tier. That's how I started listening to &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/reviews/making-it-in-america"&gt;Making It In America&lt;/a&gt;. What I didn't know was that there's a limit to the number of hours you can listen in a given month. I only got as far as chapter 2 and now I have to wait 7 days for my listening hours to be replenished for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I started building the reading backlog at the local library which is now at an unreasonable 164 books that I probably won't get to. It got that way because I added many of the Best of 2023 recommendations from my local library to my wishlist. I haven't added many of those to my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/library"&gt;library page&lt;/a&gt; because I don't want to go through the process of manually adding them. I should look into whether there's an automated way of getting that information via APIs or batch download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I started reading &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/reviews/how-to-sell-a-haunted-house"&gt;How To Sell A Haunted House&lt;/a&gt; and I'm enjoying it so far. The next one on deck is &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/reviews/a-city-on-mars"&gt;A City on Mars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Timeless habits</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Following up on the theme of cycles and looking back at things from yesteryear explored in my post &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/notes/ai-abundance-scarcity-cycle-repeats-rss-enclosure-use-case"&gt;AI abundance after scarcity cycles&lt;/a&gt;, I came across another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking through some of my old books, I came across Stephen Covey's &amp;quot;7 Habits of Highly Effective People&amp;quot;. I remember reading it over ten years ago. At the time, the habits and themes explored in the book had an impact on me. However, since that time I haven't looked at the book again. Today, I cracked it open and skimmed through the foreword. In it, Stephen talks about common human challenges such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear and insecurity - This could mean a fear of the future, like losing your job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of life balance - Put in the context of being always online, our lives continue to get more complex and demanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given recent talking points of AI coming for our jobs and the accelerated rate of technological innovation, you could pluck these challenges from the time they were written and they'd still be relevant today. You could also place them 500 or 1000 years ago and they'd also be relevant which made me think of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect"&gt;Lindy Effect&lt;/a&gt;. In short, it states that the longer a technology or idea continues to live, the higher the likelihood it will continue to exist into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it funny though that while flipping through the book and reading about these timeless challenges and principles, I came across the opposite of that. One of my bookmarks was a Borders membership card. If you don't know or remember what Borders was, in a gist, it was one of the large bookstores which succumbed to disruption from e-commerce (i.e. Amazon)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Install OverDrive Media Console on Manjaro</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Introduction

For the last few months, Manjaro has been the operating system I use as my daily driver for personal tasks. I still have my Surface Go tablet which runs Windows 10 that I use for tasks line syncing my Garmin watch and GPS. On one of the [posts in my feed](/notes/ipod-touch-discontinued), I briefly mentioned my audio solution for podcasts and audiobooks which mainly consists of a standalone MP3 player ([FiiO M6](https://fiio.com/m6)). 

For podcasts, I manage them through my [NewsBlur RSS feed reader](https://newsblur.com/). When I want to download them for offline listening, I've written a .NET console app ([podnet](https://github.com/lqdev/podnet)) to manage that process for me. Audiobooks are a little trickier. Public domain works I get through [Librivox](https://librivox.org/). The limitation there though is that I'm only public domain works are available. Therefore if I want other audiobooks, I either have to purchase them (which has its own issues because of DRM) or borrow them from my local library. I prefer to borrow my books and audiobooks from the library. Not only am I supporting my local library but I also save money in the process. 

Many libraries including my own manage digital assets through [OverDrive](https://www.overdrive.com/). OverDrive offers a variety of ways for transferring books and audiobooks to your devices. Linux however is not one of those solutions. Until February 2022, OverDrive provided a Windows desktop application (OverDrive Media Console) for managing books and audiobooks. Although there is no Linux desktop application, Linux has Wine. [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) according to their website is "...a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, &amp; BSD.". 

In this post, I'll show how you can use Wine to install OverDrive Media Console on a PC running the Manjaro Linux distribution. 

## Install Wine

In order to install OverDrive Media Console, you'll need to install Wine. To do so:

1. Open the terminal.
1. Install Wine and all its dependencies with the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S wine winetricks wine-mono wine_gecko
    ``` 

## Install OverDrive Media Console

The next step is to install the OverDrive Media Console application for Windows desktop. 

1. Download the latest version of [OverDrive Media Console for Windows Desktop application](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/overdrive./). This should be a Microsoft Installer file with the `.msi` extension. Note that as of February 2022, the desktop application is [no longer available for install](https://help.overdrive.com/en-us/0733.html?tocpath=Home%7CGet%20help%20with%20the%20OverDrive%20app%7CWindows%20(desktop)%7C_____7).
1. Open the terminal and use Wine to install OverDrive Media Console with the following command:

    ```bash
    wine msiexec /i ODMediaConsoleSetup.msi
    ```

    Update the name of the `.msi` file as needed.  

## Run OverDrive Media Console

Once the installation is complete, OverDrive Media Console should be in your list of applications. Run it as you would any other app.
