      <title>Building up the reading backlog</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been using Spotify to listen to audiobooks since it's included as part of their Premium tier. That's how I started listening to &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/reviews/making-it-in-america"&gt;Making It In America&lt;/a&gt;. What I didn't know was that there's a limit to the number of hours you can listen in a given month. I only got as far as chapter 2 and now I have to wait 7 days for my listening hours to be replenished for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I started building the reading backlog at the local library which is now at an unreasonable 164 books that I probably won't get to. It got that way because I added many of the Best of 2023 recommendations from my local library to my wishlist. I haven't added many of those to my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/library"&gt;library page&lt;/a&gt; because I don't want to go through the process of manually adding them. I should look into whether there's an automated way of getting that information via APIs or batch download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night I started reading &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/reviews/how-to-sell-a-haunted-house"&gt;How To Sell A Haunted House&lt;/a&gt; and I'm enjoying it so far. The next one on deck is &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/reviews/a-city-on-mars"&gt;A City on Mars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
