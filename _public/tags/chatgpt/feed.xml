      <title>How people use ChatGPT</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the rapid adoption of LLM chatbots, little is known about how they are used. We document the growth of ChatGPT‚Äôs consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10% of the world‚Äôs adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of ChatGPT conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53% to more than 70% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation topic and find that ‚ÄúPractical Guidance,‚Äù ‚ÄúSeeking Information,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWriting‚Äù are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots‚Äô unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that ChatGPT provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Claude Artifacts</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;p&gt;üíØüíØüíØ. Artifacts are great. In ChatGPT when I find myself trying to format outputs as markdown, the UI gets confused and some of the content is rendered in markdown while the rest gets rendered as part of the UI which makes it unusable and hard to copy. The best way I've found to get around it is to ask it to format in org-mode or asciidoc. Claude Artifacts make this a non-issue. I also love that in addition to copying and downloading the artifact, you can also publish it as a URL.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Start using ChatGPT instantly</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre making it easier for people to experience the benefits of AI without needing to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may use what you provide to ChatGPT to improve our models for everyone. If you‚Äôd like, you can turn this off through your Settings - whether you create an account or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve also introduced additional content safeguards for this experience, such as blocking prompts and generations in a wider range of categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Memory and new controls for ChatGPT</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre testing memory with ChatGPT. Remembering things you discuss across all chats saves you from having to repeat information and makes future conversations more helpful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You're in control of ChatGPT's memory. You can explicitly tell it to remember something, ask it what it remembers, and tell it to forget conversationally or through settings. You can also turn it off entirely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We are rolling out to a small portion of ChatGPT free and Plus users this week to learn how useful it is. We will share plans for broader roll out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>ChatGPT can now see, hear, and speak</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are beginning to roll out new voice and image capabilities in ChatGPT. They offer a new, more intuitive type of interface by allowing you to have a voice conversation or show ChatGPT what you‚Äôre talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
