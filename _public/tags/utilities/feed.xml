      <title>Fitch: CLI system information utility built with F#</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I wasn't really planning on this, but here we are. I've been using &lt;a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch"&gt;Neofetch&lt;/a&gt; on my PC to display system information whenever the terminal opens. However, in some cases, that would hang and it would take a while before I was able to use my terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then ran into &lt;a href="https://github.com/unxsh/nitch"&gt;Nitch&lt;/a&gt; which is simple and fast. However, it was missing the local and public IP information Neofetch provides out of the box. Nitch is written using the &lt;a href="https://nim-lang.org/"&gt;Nim&lt;/a&gt; programming language. Originally, I had planned on extending Nitch and I figured out the code I needed to write to support IP information. However, my program wouldn't build and I was unable to find any information online to unblock myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when I looked at the existing components in Nitch and found that it was basically just reading files from the &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; system directories. At that point, I decided to see if I could build my own utility using F#. A couple of hours later and the result was &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/github/fitch"&gt;Fitch&lt;/a&gt;. This works well enough for my needs and in the future, I might publish it as a dotnet global tool to make it easy for others to use.&lt;/p&gt;
