      <title>How to Multistream Using Azure, Azure VM, MonaServer 2, and FFmpeg with OBS Studio</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we will set up a multistreaming workflow using Azure, an Azure VM, MonaServer 2, and FFmpeg to broadcast to multiple platforms like LinkedIn Live and YouTube Live. We’ll use OBS Studio as the main streaming software. Let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love this detailed writeup from &lt;a href="https://maho.dev/"&gt;Maho&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I originally experimented with something similar using my Owncast instance, I was running ffmpeg locally but I like his solution better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simulcasting to Owncast and YouTube</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, I was telling &lt;a href="https://maho.dev/"&gt;maho.dev&lt;/a&gt; about Owncast and my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/posts/deploy-owncast-azure"&gt;self-hosted setup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our chat, the question of simulcasting came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-studio-stream-to-multiple-platforms-or-channels-at-once.932/"&gt;guidance from the OBS community&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point, I decided to try it out for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't work as-is but after using an AI assistant to help me tweak the ffmpeg command, I was able to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted the command to my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/resources/wiki/owncast"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt; and plan on writing a more detailed post at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deploy your own Owncast server</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
I'm a fan of learning in public. One way I do that is writing these types of posts. Another is live-streaming. It's been about four years since the last time I streamed. You can check out some of those recordings on my [YouTube channel](/youtube) if you're interested.

Lately, I've been wanting to get back into live-streaming, but like many parts of my digital presence, it's an area I want ownership over. That means, I don't want to use Twitch, YouTube, Kick, or any other streaming platform. I want to self-host my own livestream server. 

For years, I've been following [Owncast](https://owncast.online/). I'm a big fan. Aside from being open-source and allowing me to self-host, it has [Fediverse](https://owncast.online/docs/social/) and [IndieAuth](https://owncast.online/docs/chat/chat-authentication/#indieauth) integrations.

Because I don't plan to monetize my streams, I want to make sure I keep my costs down. Owncast offers a container deployment option. That means, I can deploy my application to [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview) using a [consumption plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/plans#consumption). By doing so, I only pay for compute and networking when I'm streaming. The rest of the time, I can scale down the application to zero and I'm not charged for it. 

In this post, I'll go over how to set up a self-hosted Owncast instance on Azure Container Apps and once deployed, how to configure it with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). 

## Deploy owncast server

The deployment is fairly straightforward. You can use the ["Provide a virtual network to an Azure Container Apps environment"](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/vnet-custom?tabs=bash&amp;pivots=azure-portal) tutorial. I'd recommend going through the portal if you don't want to install the Azure CLI or are not comfortable with the command line. 

The few configurations that tutorial doesn't guide you through is setting up your container and ingress since those are application specific. 

After you configure your environment and virtual network in the *Basics* tab, continue your setup using the steps below. 

### Container

To set up Owncast, you can use the [public docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncast/owncast/tags).

When you get to the *Container* tab in the setup process, fill in the fields with the following values:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Enter a name for your container |
| Image source | Docker Hub or other registies |
| Image type | Public |
| Registry login server | docker.io |
| Image and tag | owncast/owncast:latest |
| Command override | You can leave this blank |
| Arguments override | You can leave this blank |
| Deployment stack | Generic |
| Workload profile | Consumption |
| CPU and Memory | 2 CPU Cores, 4Gi Memory |

### Ingress 

By setting up ingress on your deployment, you'll expose the ports Owncast listens on. 

The reason you need a virtual network is because Owncast listens on two ports:

- **8080** - The web application and admin portal
- **1935** - The RMTP server used for streaming

By default, Azure Container Apps only allows you to expose one port. For more details, see the [Azure Container Apps documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/ingress-overview#additional-tcp-ports). 

In the *Ingress* tab, check the box that says **Enabled**.

Then, fill in the fields with the following values:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Ingress traffic | Accepting traffic from anywhere |
| Ingress type | HTTP |
| Transport | Auto |
| Insecure connections | Leave unchecked |
| Target port | 8080 |
| Session affinity | Leave unchecked | 

Expand the Additional TCP ports section and configure the RMTP port

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Target port | 1935 |
| Exposed port | 1935 |
| Ingress traffic | Accepting traffic from anywhere |

Once you've configured ingress, you can select on **Review + create**.

Review your configurations in the *Review + create* tab. If everything looks good, select **Create**. 

## **IMPORTANT** Change admin password

Once your application deploys, make sure to change your admin password. 

1. In the portal, go to your container app resource and copy your application URL.

    ![Screenshot of Azure Container Apps resource in Azure Portal highlighting Application URL](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/portal-container-resource.png)

    Make sure to keek your application URL around since you'll also be using it when configuring OBS. 

1. Access the admin portal at the following URL - `&lt;YOUR-APPLICATION-URL&gt;/admin`. Replace `&lt;YOUR-APPLICATION-URL&gt;` with your application URL.
1. Log in with the default credentials.

| Field | Value |
| Username | admin |
| Password | abc123 |

1. In the Owncast admin portal, select **Configuration &gt; Server Setup**
1. Change your admin password.

For more details, see the [Owncast documentation](https://owncast.online/docs/configuration/). 

## Create stream key

Once you've changed your admin password, create a stream key. This will enable you to log into your server through OBS and begin streaming. 

1. In the Owncast admin portal, select **Configuration &gt; Server Setup**
1. Select the **Stream Keys** tab.
1. Copy the default stream key or create a new one.

## Configure OBS

Now that everything is configured, it's time to set up OBS. 

To do so, [follow the guidance in the Owncast documentattion](https://owncast.online/docs/broadcasting/obs/).

Replace the server address with your application URL and use the stream key you copied or created. Note that the protocol is not `http` or `https`. **Use `rmtp`**.

That's it! If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to select **Start Streaming** in OBS. 

Go to your Owncast instance using your application URL and in a few seconds, your broadcast should start. 

## Conclusion

I want to end by thanking the Owncast contributors and community for making self-hosting a live-streaming server so easy. 

My plan in the next couple of weeks is to:

1. Embed my stream on my website. Most likely, I'll make it a dedicated page. Something like `lqdev.me/live` or something like that.
1. Do a few pilot streams to make sure my stream quality and configurations are all set up correctly.
1. Evaluate what the costs are for this solution and whethere it's sustainable.

If all goes as expected, I'll start streaming more regularly. As mentioned, I want to keep my costs down and video hosting is expensive, so I'll use YouTube to post recordings. I'll also keep backups though in case any of those videos get taken down, I can always have a local copy still available. ]]&gt;</description>

      <title>Got an Owncast instance deployed to Azure!</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I started tinkering with Owncast. In that case, I was figuring out how I could use .NET Aspire and Blazor to &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/posts/build-your-own-live-streaming-app-owncast-dotnet-aspire/"&gt;configure an Owncast server and embed the stream on a website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn't go all the way through creating the deployment, doing so with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/deployment/azure/aca-deployment"&gt;Aspire would've been fairly straightforward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I already have a website, all I care about deploying is the Owncast server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending about an hour on it today, I was able deploy and Owncast server to Azure Container Apps using the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/vnet-custom?tabs=bash&amp;amp;pivots=azure-portal"&gt;virtual network environment setup tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part was figuring out that I needed to set up a virtual network in order to publicly expose multiple ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the server was up and running, configuring OBS was relatively easy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll try to put together a more detailed writeup so I remember what I did for next time as well as help others who may be interested in self-hosting their own livestream server.&lt;/p&gt;
