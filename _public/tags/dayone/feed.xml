      <title>Introducing Shared Journals for Day One</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared Journals are a private space for your closest friends and family to shared life updates and memories. Shared Journals introduce a new dimension to journaling, offering a unique way to share your personal stories and experiences with up to 30 selected individuals, while keeping your individual entries private and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome! When I was writing the post &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/notes/private-social-media"&gt;Private Social Media&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, I wasn't aware that these had already launched. I knew they were in beta but it's great to see they're now generally available. I'll have to give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Journaling Suggestions for Day One</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See journaling recommendations inspired by your photos, locations, activities and more. Exclusively for iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been tinkering with Day One the past few months. When paired with their templates, this is a nice addition. Too bad it's iPhone exclusive. Hopefully it makes its way to Android at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
