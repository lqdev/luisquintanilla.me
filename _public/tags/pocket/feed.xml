      <title>Pocket shutting down</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;p&gt;I haven't used Pocket in a long time but sad to hear it's shutting down. It's great they're offering the option of letting you export your data and platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.manton.org/2025/05/22/with-pocket-shutting-down-ive.html"&gt;Micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; are making it easy to host that content on your own site (assuming you're using Micro.blog).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bookmarking solutions, I've been using my website as well as messages-to-self on Element. What's on my website is the content that I really want to make sure I archive, whereas the messages to self I treat more as a read-it-later solution. Eventually, some of those make it to my website. I'm working on my mobile publishing flow to simplify my bookmarking process but overall, I'm happy with my current system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also another great reminder why owning your content is important.&lt;/p&gt;
