      <title>Setting up your Rust development environment using Dev Containers</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
Setting up a new development environment that's configured with all the SDKs and tools you need to get started working can be a multi-step process that is error-prone. Especially when you don't know whether you want to commit to a specific technology or don't have too much space on your device, you might not want to install everything on your device. Additionally, cleaning up and removing everything you installed isn't always 100%. This is where development environments like Dev Containers can come in handy. 

## What are Dev Containers

A development container (Dev Container) lets you use a container as a full development environment. 

Because your development environment is in a container, the environment is isolated. The builds are reproducible and disposable. This means you can quickly stand up a new clean development environments and dispose of them just as easily. 

For more details, see the [Dev Containers website](https://containers.dev/).

If you have Docker installed, you can run them locally. Otherwise, you can run Dev Containers using GitHub Codespaces

## What are GitHub Codespaces

A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud.

For more details, see the [GitHub Codespaces website](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## Set up Dev Container for Rust Development

1. Create a new directory.
1. Add a Dev Container configuration file called *.devcontainer.json* that contains the following content:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Rust Development Environment",
        "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/rust:latest",
        "customizations": {
            "vscode": {
                "extensions": [
                    "rust-lang.rust-analyzer"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    - **name**: A human friendly name to identify your development environment. It's not as important when you only have one environment but if you have different environments, it can be useful for differentiating between the various configurations. 
    - **image**: For the most customization, you can provide the path to a Docker file. However, to make things easier, there are a set of prebuilt container images. In this case, I'm using the [Rust image](https://github.com/devcontainers/images/tree/main/src/rust).
    - **customizations.vscode.extensions**: A list of Visual Studio Code extensions that can help you with your development. In this case, it's the [*rust-analyzer*](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer).

At minimum, this is all you need to get started. 

## Start your environment 

[Visual Studio Code provides good support for Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial). 

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. Open your directory where you configured your Dev Container in Visual Studio Code
1. Install the [Dev Containers VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
1. Open the command palette in VS Code. In the menu bar, select **View &gt; Command Palette.**
1. Enter the following command **&gt;Dev Containers: Open Dev Container**. This will start building your dev container. Wait for it to start.

## Check your environment

Once your Dev Container starts, check that `rustc` is installed.

1. Open the terminal.
1. Run `rustc -h`. A help message should output to the console for the Rust compiler. 

## Build your app

For simplicity, I've used the [Hello World sample from the Rust By Example website](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/hello.html).

1. Create a new file called *hello.rs*.
1. Add the following code:

    ```rust
    fn main ()
    {
        println!("Hello World!");
    }
    ```
1. Compile your program

    ```bash
    rustc hello.rs
    ```

    This will generate an executable called *hello*

1. Run your app

    ```bash
    ./hello
    ```

    The application should print out the string "Hello World" to the console. 

That's it! You now have a Rust development environment to get started learning and building apps. 

## Conclusion

Dev Containers make it easy for you to configure full-featured development environments. When paired with Visual Studio Code and GitHub Codespaces, they can help you focus on learning and building applications rather than setting up your environment. You can find a [final version of the configured environment and app on GitHub](https://github.com/lqdev/rust-codespace-sandbox). Happy coding!

      <title>Operationalizing Machine Learning with ML.NET, Azure DevOps and Azure Container Instances</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

## Introduction

Azure DevOps, formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), helps individuals and organizations plan, collaborate and ship products faster. One if its noteworthy services, Azure Pipelines, helps developers build Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines that automate and standardize the build, test and deploy phases of the software development process. In addition, Azure Pipelines provides native container support and works with any language, platform and cloud. Machine learning like software development is also a process that includes a build, test and deploy phase which makes it a good candidate for automation and standardization. At Build 2018, Microsoft announced [ML.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning), an open-source, cross-plaform machine learning framework for .NET. If we were to put all of these tools and services together, it means that we can automate and standardize the training of a machine learning model built with ML.NET, package it into a Docker container and deploy it to Azure Container Instances (ACI). In this writeup, I will go through the process of building a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Devops that trains, packages and deploys an ML.NET machine learning model to predict which class an Iris flower belongs to using a variety of measurements. Source code for this project can be found at this [link](https://github.com/lqdev/mlnetazdevopssample).

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)  
- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

## The Application

Because the purpose of this post is to demonstrate the functionality of Azure Devops and not that of ML.NET, I'll start with a pre-built application. For some more information and detail into the functionality of ML.NET, check out the official documentation [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/) as well as some of my previous posts: 

- [Serverless Machine Learning with ML.NET and Azure Functions](http://luisquintanilla.me/2018/08/21/serverless-machine-learning-mlnet-azure-functions/)
- [Deploy .NET Machine Learning Models with ML.NET, ASP.NET Core, Docker and Azure Container Instances](http://luisquintanilla.me/2018/05/11/deploy-netml-docker-aci/).

The application used in this writeup contains three .NET Core projects within it. One is a class library which is what we'll use to wrap ML.NET functionality for training models as well as loading pre-trained models that will then be used to make predictions. Another is a .NET Core console application which references the class library to train and persist an ML.NET model. Finally, there's the ASP.NET Core Web API which also references the class library application to load the pre-trained model created by the console application and then makes predictions via HTTP. This application can be utilized and deployed standalone but in this writeup it will be packaged into a Docker image that will then be deployed to Azure Container Instances.

### Class Library

The class library can be found in the `MLModel` directory. The class library defines the observation and prediction data classes which can be found in the `IrisData.cs` and `IrisPrediction.cs` files respectively. Additionally, the `Model` class contains helper methods that train and save machine learning models, load pre-trained models and use these models to make predictions. 

### Console Application

In the solution directory we also have a console application in the `ModelTrainer` directory. This application references the class library in the `MLModel` directory to train and persist the machine learning model. 

### API

The `ModelApi` directory contains an ASP.NET Core Web API application that references the `MLModel` class library project to load the pre-trained model that is trained by the `ModelTrainer` console application and makes predictions via HTTP. The logic for making predictions can be found in the `PredictController.cs` class in the `Controllers` directory of the `ModelApi` application. 

## CI/CD Pipeline Flow

Conceptually, when the application is built and deployed manually, the machine learning model is defined and developed inside the `MLModel` class library. Once satisfied with the model, the class library is built. The console application which references the `MLModel` class library is built as well as run to train and persist a classification model in a file called `model.zip`. The `MLModel` class library is also referenced in the `ModelApi` ASP.NET Core project. Because `ModelApi` is the application we're looking to deploy in order to expose our pre-trained machine learning model, we need to find a way to package it for deployment. We'll be deploying `ModelApi` using Azure Container Instances which means we need to create a Docker image of the project that will then be pushed to a Docker registry where it will be made available for public consumption. The building of multiple projects as well as the building, publishing and deployment of the Docker image to Azure Container Instances can be standardized and automated using Azure DevOps. The rest of this write-up will focus on demonstrating step-by-step how to operationalize this machine learning application via CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps using Azure Pipelines.   

### Getting The Code

Before getting started, the first thing you'll want to do is fork the [mlnetazdevopssample](https://github.com/lqdev/mlnetazdevopssample) GitHub repository into your own GitHub account.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-2.png)

### Creating the Project

Navigate to [https://devops.azure.com](https://devops.azure.com), click `Start Free` and follow the prompts to either create a new account or sign into your existing account.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-3.png)

Once logged in, click `Create Project`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-4.png)

Enter the name of your project as well as a short description. Then, click `Create`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-5.png)

## The Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

Using Azure Pipelines, we'll configure a CI pipeline for the build and packaging steps of our application. Below is an illustration of all the steps involved in our CI pipeline:

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-6.png)

1. Build the class library application
2. Build the console application
3. Train and persist the ML.NET Model by running the console application.
4. Copy ML.NET model file created by console application into ASP.NET Core Web API application directory
5. Build ASP.NET Core Web API application
6. Build Docker image 
7. Push Docker image to Docker Hub

### CI Pipeline Setup

Once the project is created, in the main project page, hover over `Pipelines` and click on `Builds`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-7.png)

In the `Builds` pipeline page, click `New pipeline`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-8.png)

Select GitHub as the source and connect your GitHub account with Azure DevOps.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-9.png)

Once you have authorized Azure DevOps to use your GitHub account, select the repository and branch that will be used for this build pipeline. In our case, we'll be using the master branch of the `mlnetazdevopssample` repository. When finished configuring, click `Continue`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-10.png)

The next step will be to select the jobs to execute in our pipeline. Because there are multiple steps in this build pipeline, let's start with an `Empty Job` and customize it to our needs.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-11.png)

From inside the build pipeline page, before we start adding jobs, lets select the agent that will execute the jobs. For this pipeline, select the `Hosted Ubuntu 1604` option from the dropdown.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-12.png)

### 1. Build the Class Library Application

The first step in our CI Pipeline will be to build our class library which contains methods that wrap the training, loading and prediction functionality of the ML.NET framework and persisted models.

To achieve that, we'll add a .NET Core task to our `Agent Job 1`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-13.png)

Once added to the pipeline, let's configure this task. To make it more descriptive, we can give it a name such as `Build Class Library`. Because this task will be responsible for building the .NET Core class library, we'll leave the default `build` Command setting as is. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-14.png)

The other setting we'll want to configure is the `Working Directory`. We can do so by clicking the `Advanced` tab. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-15.png)

For this task we'll use the `MLModel` directory.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-16.png)

When finished with the configuration, click `Save &amp; Queue` -&gt; `Save` on the top toolbar.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-17.png)

Enter a detailed comment describing the change to the pipeline and click `Save`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-18.png)

### 2. Building The Console Application

Once we've built the class library application which we'll reference from the .NET Core console and ASP.NET Core Web API applications, it's time to build the console application which will serve the purpose of training and persisting the ML.NET model.

Similar to the previous step, add a new .NET Core *build* task to the pipeline. The only setting that will change for this task is the `Working Directory` which will have the value of `ModelTrainer`. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-19.png)

Although not required, when finished configuring the task, click `Save &amp; Queue` -&gt; `Save` to save and comment the changes to the pipeline. 

### 3. Train and persist the ML.NET Model

Now that our console application is built, it's time to run it in order to train and persist the ML.NET model. To do so, we'll add another .NET Core task. The difference is that the `Command` setting will now be configured with the `run` value. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-20.png)

The `Working Directory` will be set to `ModelTrainer` like in the previous task.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-21.png)

Remember to save and comment the new changes to the pipeline.

### 4. Copy ML.NET Model to Web API Directory

After the console application is run and the ML.NET model is trained, it is persisted in a file called `model.zip` inside the `ModelTrainer` directory. We can use this persisted version of the model to make predictions from both the console application or any other application of our choice. In this case, we'll be making predictions via an ASP.NET Core Web API. In order for our API to reference this file, we need to copy it into the root directory of our `ModelApi` directory. A way to perform that task is via bash script. To add a bash script to our pipeline, all we need to do is add a Bash task to it. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-22.png)

Once added to our pipeline, it's time to configure the task. We'll set the `Type` setting to `Inline` which will bring up a text box for us to type in the script. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-23.png)

Inside of the text box, enter the following content:

```bash
# Write your commands here

cp ../ModelTrainer/model.zip .

# Use the environment variables input below to pass secret variables to this script
```

This command will copy the `model.zip` file from the `ModelTrainer` directory to the `ModelApi` directory.

We can set the `Working Directory` of this step to `ModelApi`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-24.png)

Once finished, save and comment the new changes to the pipeline. 

### 5. Build ASP.NET Core Web API application

Now that we have the necessary files inside our `ModelApi` application, it's time to build it. We'll add a .NET Core task to our pipeline and set the `Command` to `build`. The `Working Directory` will be `ModelApi` like the previous task.

Save and comment the new changes to the pipeline when finished.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-25.png)

### 6. Build ASP.NET Core Web API Docker Image

The method of deployment for the ASP.NET Core Web API application is via containers. Therefore, after building the application, we have to build a Docker image for it that can then be pushed to a Docker registry of your choice. To build a Docker image, we'll add a Docker task to our pipeline.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-26.png)

When we configure the task, we'll start off by setting the `Container Registry Type` to `Container Registry`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-27.png)

This will prompt the setup of a service connection to a Docker registry if one does not already exist.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-28.png)

The Docker registry type we'll be using is Docker Hub. Give the connection a name, enter the credentials to your Docker Hub account and click `Verify this connection` to make sure that your credentials are valid and a connection can be established with Docker Hub. When finished click `OK`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-29.png)

The `Command` setting will be `build` so we can leave the default as is as well as the `Dockerfile` setting which will use the Dockerfile in the root `mlnetazdevopssample` directory.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-30.png)

Finally, we'll configure the `Image name` setting. The convention we'll use is `&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;`. In my case, `lqdev` is my Docker Hub username and I'll name my image `mlnetazdevopssample` resulting in `lqdev/mlnetazdevopssample`. Additionally, check the `Include latest tag` checkbox to have every build be the latest as opposed to tagging it with versions numbers. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-31.png)

Remember to save and comment the recent changes to the pipeline.

### 7. Push Docker Image to Docker Hub

The last step in our CI pipeline is to push our newly built image to Docker Hub. To do so we'll use anoter Docker task. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-32.png)

Like in the previous task, we'll set the `Container registry type` to `Container Registry`. Set the `Docker registry service connection` to the most recently created connection by selecting it from the dropdown. We'll be changing our `Command` to `push` and set the `Image name` to the name of the image built in the previous step. The naming convention is `&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;:latest`. The latest tag was added by our previous Docker build task so make sure that you include it in this task.

Once finished, click `Save &amp; Queue` -&gt; `Save &amp; Queue`. As opposed to only clicking `Save`, this action will manually trigger the CI pipeline.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-33.png)

Don't forget to comment your changes and click `Save &amp; queue` to kick off the CI pipeline.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-34.png)

### Monitoring the Build

When the build starts, you can click on `Builds` under the `Pipelines` section on the left pane.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-35.png)

Select the first build from the list to get more details on the build.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-36.png)

This will take you to the logs which show the status of the pipeline near real-time.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-37.png)

### Confirming CI Pipeline Success

If the build is successful, navigate to [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/) to check whether the Docker image was pushed to the registry.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-38.png)

## The Continuous Delivery (CD) Pipeline

Now that we have our CI pipeline set up which will build and package our application, it's time to deploy it. We could do this ourselves or automate it using a CD pipeline. Our application wil be deployed to Azure Container Instances which is an Azure service that offers a quick way to run containers without having to worry about the management of virtual machines or orchestration services. The steps involved in our CD pipeline are the following:

1. Create Azure Resource Group for deployment
2. Deploy application to Azure Container Instances.

### CD Pipeline Setup

To get started setting up a CD pipeline, from the Azure DevOps project main page, hover over `Pipelines` and click on `Releases`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-39.png)

Once in that page, click on `New pipeline`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-40.png)

As with our CI pipeline, we'll start off with an `Empty Job` which we'll configure at a later time.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-41.png)

### Triggering Deployments

Once our pipeline is created, it's time to configure it. The first thing we'll want to do is add an artifact. An artifact can be a variety of things including the output of our build pipeline. In our case, the end our CI pipeline will be the trigger for our CD pipeline. To add an artifact, click `Add an artifact`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-42.png)

In the configuration form, set the `Source type` to `Build` and the `Source` to the name of the CI pipeline created in the previous steps. When finished, click `Add`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-43.png)


After configuring our artifact, it's time to configure the steps in the CD pipeline. To do so, click on the `Stage 1` option in the `Stages` section of the release pipeline page and change the name to something more descriptive.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-44.png)

When finished, close out the form and click on the hyperlink below the stage title. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-45.png)

You should now be on a page similar to the CI pipeline job configuration page. On this page, we'll want to click on the `Agent Job` panel to set the `Agent pool` setting to `Hosted Ubuntu 1604`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-46.png)

Once that is complete, it's time to configure the tasks in the CD pipeline.

### 1. Create Azure Resource Group

Start off adding an `Azure CLI` task to the pipeline. In this task we'll create a resource group in Azure to which we'll deploy our application to. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-47.png)

Before doing anything else, link DevOps to an Azure Subscription by selecting one from the dropdown and clicking `Authorize` which will prompt you to authenticate your subscription. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-48.png)

Once an Azure subscription has been linked, let's change the `Script Location` setting to `Inline Script`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-49.png)

In the `Inline Script` text box enter the following:

```bash
az group create --name mlnetazdevopssampleresourcegroup --location eastus
```
This script will create a resource group in Azure called `mlnetazdevopssampleresourcegroup` that is located in `eastus`. Both of these are configurable to your preference. 

### 2. Deploy Docker Image to Azure Container Instances

The next and final step in our CD pipeline is the deployment to Azure Container Instances. To deploy our application, we'll add another `Azure CLI` task. This time, since we already configured our `Azure subscription` in the previous task, we can select the service connection as opposed to a subscription from the dropdown.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-50.png)

Like in the previous task, our script will be inline. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-51.png)

In the `Inline Script` text box enter the following:

```bash
az container create --resource-group mlnetazdevopssampleresourcegroup --name mlnetcontainer --image lqdev/mlnetazdevopssample:latest --ports 80 --ip-address public
```

This script creates a container in the resource group created by the previous task of the pipeline with the name `mlnetcontainer` from the Docker image that was pushed to Docker Hub by the CI pipeline. Additionally, it opens up port 80 and assigns a publicly accessible IP address for the container to be accessed externally. 

Once this step has been configured, make sure to save and comment all your changes by clicking `Save`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-52.png)

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-53.png)

Then, to make it easily recognizable, edit the name of the pipeline by hovering near `New release pipeline` and clicking on the pencil icon.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-54.png)

Make sure to save and comment your changes.

## Automating CI/CD Pipelines

In the previous steps, we configured CI and CD pipelines. However, we have still not fully automated the triggers that kick off both of these. 

### CI Pipeline Trigger

First, lets start off by automating the CI pipeline. To do so, go the project's main page, hover over `Pipelines` and click on `Builds`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-55.png)

This will take you to the CI pipeline page. While on this page, click `Edit`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-56.png)

Then, click on `Triggers`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-57.png)

Once on this page, check the `Enable continous integration` checkbox and save and comment your changes by clicking `Save &amp; Queue` -&gt; `Save`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-58.png)


### CD Pipeline Trigger

To automate the CD pipeline trigger, click on `Releases` under the `Pipelines` page to automate the CD pipeline.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-59.png)

Once on the CD pipeline's page, click `Edit`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-60.png)

Then, click on the lightning icon in the Artifacts section which will show a configuration form. In this form, toggle the `Continuous deployment trigger` setting to `Enabled`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-61.png)

When finished, save and comment your changes. 

## Running CI/CD Pipelines

Although going forward builds and deployments will be started when new changes are checked into the master branch of the `mlnetazdevopssample` repository, for demonstration purposes we will manually kick off the CI/CD pipelines we have just configured. To do so, click on `Builds` under the `Pipelines` section on the left pane.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-62.png)

From the CI pipeline page click `Queue`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-63.png)

This will prompt a modal to show up in which you can just click `Queue` to start the build.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-64.png)

This will kick off a new CI build which subsequently will also kick off the CD pipeline of your application. 

## Testing The Deployment

If all is successful, a Docker image of an ASP.NET Core Web API application will be deployed to Azure Container Instances which can be accessed via a public IP address. 

To see whether the deployment worked, navigate to [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) and click on `Resource groups`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-65.png)

At this point, you should see the resource group that was created by the CD pipeline. If that's the case, click on it. 

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-66.png)

This will then show a page that displays the container that was deployed to this resource group. Click on that.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-67.png)

The container page will display diagnostic and configuration information about the container. The information we're interested in is the `IP address`. Hover to the right of it and click on the icon that says `Click to copy`. This will copy the address to the clipboard.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-68.png)

In an application like Postman or Insomnia, make an HTTP POST request to `http://&lt;ip-address&gt;/api/predict` where `ip-address` is the public IP address of the container in Azure with the following body.

```json
{
    "SepalLength":3.3,
    "SepalWidth":1.6,
    "PetalLength":0.2,
    "PetalWidth":5.1
}
```

If successful, the response will be `Iris-virginica`.

![](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/azdevops-mlnet-69.png)

## Conclusion

In this writeup, we operationalized the building, packaging and deployment of an ML.NET application that predicts the class of an Iris flower using a variety of mesurements with Azure DevOps. We created both a Continous Integration as well as a Continous Delivery pipeline which deploys the Docker image of an ASP.NET Core Web API to Azure Container Instances. Keep in mind this is just one way of doing it and Azure DevOps is flexible in how all of these tasks and workflows are configured to meet your requirements. Happy coding!

      <title>Deploy .NET Machine Learning Models with ML.NET, ASP.NET Core, Docker and Azure Container Instances</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

# Introduction

Leading up to and during MS Build 2018 Microsoft has released a wide range of products that reduce the complexity that comes with building and deploying software. The focus this year was on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Some of the products I found particularly interesting are [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/) which makes it easier to run containerized applications without provisioning or managing servers and [ML.NET](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet) which is a .NET cross-platform machine learning framework. In this writeup, I will make use of both these products by creating a machine learning classification model with `ML.NET`, exposing it via an ASP.NET Core Web API, packaging it into a Docker container and deploying it to the cloud via Azure Container Instances. Source code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/lqdev/mlnetacidemo).

## Prerequisites

This writeup assumes that you have some familiarity with Docker. The following software/dependencies are also required to build and deploy the sample application. It's important to note the application was built on a Ubuntu 16.04 PC, but all the software is cross-platform and should work on any environment.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [.NET Core 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux)
- [Docker Hub Account](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Setting Up The Project

The first thing we want to do is create a folder for our solution.

```bash
mkdir mlnetacidemo
```

Then, we want to create a solution inside our newly created folder.

```bash
cd mlnetacidemo
dotnet new sln
```

## Building The Model

Inside our solution folder, we want to create a new console application which is where we'll build and test our machine learning model.

### Setting Up the Model Project

First, we want to create the project. From the solution folder enter:

```bash
dotnet new console -o model
```

Now we want to add this new project to our solution.

```bash
dotnet sln mlnetacidemo.sln add model/model.csproj
```

### Adding Dependencies

Since we'll be using the `ML.NET` framework, we need to add it to our `model` project.

```bash
cd model
dotnet add package Microsoft.ML
dotnet restore
```

### Download The Data

Before we start training the model, we need to download the data we'll be using to train. We do so by creating a directory called `data` and downloading the data file onto there.

```bash
mkdir data
curl -o data/iris.txt https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
```

If we take a look at the data file, it should look something like this:

```text
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa
5.0,3.6,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
5.4,3.9,1.7,0.4,Iris-setosa

### Train Model

Now that we have all our dependencies set up, it's time to build our model. I leveraged the demo that is used on the [ML.NET Getting-Started website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet/get-started/linux/ubuntu16-04).

#### Defining Data Structures

In the root directory of our `model` project, let's create two classes called `IrisData` and `IrisPrediction` which will define our features and predicted attribute respectively. Both of them will use `Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Api` to add the property attributes.

Here is what our `IrisData` class looks like: 
```csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Api;

namespace model
{
public class IrisData
    {
        [Column("0")]
        public float SepalLength;

        [Column("1")]
        public float SepalWidth;

        [Column("2")]
        public float PetalLength;
        
        [Column("3")]
        public float PetalWidth;

        [Column("4")]
        [ColumnName("Label")]
        public string Label;
    }       
}
```

Similarly, here is the `IrisPrediction` class:

```csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Api;

namespace model
{
    public class IrisPrediction
    {
        [ColumnName("PredictedLabel")]
        public string PredictedLabels;
    }
}
```

#### Building Training Pipeline

The way the `ML.NET` computations process is via a sequential pipeline of steps that are performed eventually leading up to the training of the model. Therefore, we can create a class called `Model` to perform all of these tasks for us.

```csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Data;
using Microsoft.ML;
using Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Api;
using Microsoft.ML.Trainers;
using Microsoft.ML.Transforms;
using Microsoft.ML.Models;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace model
{
    class Model
    {
        
        public static async Task&lt;PredictionModel&lt;IrisData,IrisPrediction&gt;&gt; Train(LearningPipeline pipeline, string dataPath, string modelPath)
        {
            // Load Data
            pipeline.Add(new TextLoader(dataPath).CreateFrom&lt;IrisData&gt;(separator:',')); 

            // Transform Data
            // Assign numeric values to text in the "Label" column, because 
            // only numbers can be processed during model training   
            pipeline.Add(new Dictionarizer("Label"));

            // Vectorize Features
            pipeline.Add(new ColumnConcatenator("Features", "SepalLength", "SepalWidth", "PetalLength", "PetalWidth"));

            // Add Learner
            pipeline.Add(new StochasticDualCoordinateAscentClassifier());

            // Convert Label back to text 
            pipeline.Add(new PredictedLabelColumnOriginalValueConverter() {PredictedLabelColumn = "PredictedLabel"});

            // Train Model
            var model = pipeline.Train&lt;IrisData,IrisPrediction&gt;();

            // Persist Model
            await model.WriteAsync(modelPath);

            return model;
        }
    }
}
```

In addition to building our pipeline and training our machine learning model, the `Model` class also serialized and persisted the model for future use in a file called `model.zip`.

#### Testing Our Model

Now that we have our data structures and model training pipeline set up, it's time to test everything to make sure it's working. We'll put our logic inside of our `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.ML;

namespace model
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {

            string dataPath = "model/data/iris.txt";

            string modelPath = "model/model.zip";

            var model = Model.Train(new LearningPipeline(),dataPath,modelPath).Result;

            // Test data for prediction
            var prediction = model.Predict(new IrisData() 
            {
                SepalLength = 3.3f,
                SepalWidth = 1.6f,
                PetalLength = 0.2f,
                PetalWidth = 5.1f
            });

            Console.WriteLine($"Predicted flower type is: {prediction.PredictedLabels}");
        }
    }
}
```

All set to run. We can do so by entering the following command from our solution directory:

```bash
dotnet run -p model/model.csproj
```

Once the application has been run, the following output should display on the console. 

```text
Automatically adding a MinMax normalization transform, use 'norm=Warn' or
'norm=No' to turn this behavior off.Using 2 threads to train.
Automatically choosing a check frequency of 2.Auto-tuning parameters: maxIterations = 9998.
Auto-tuning parameters: L2 = 2.667734E-05.
Auto-tuning parameters: L1Threshold (L1/L2) = 0.Using best model from iteration 882.
Not training a calibrator because it is not needed.
Predicted flower type is: Iris-virginica
```

Additionally, you'll notice that a file called `model.zip` was created in the root directory of our `model` project. This persisted model can now be used outside of our application to make predictions, which is what we'll do next via an API.

## Exposing The Model

Once a machine learning model is built, you want to deploy it so it can start making predictions. One way to do that is via a REST API. At it's core, all our API needs to do is accept data input from the client and respond back with a prediction. To help us do that, we'll be using an ASP.NET Core API.

### Setting Up The API Project

The first thing we want to do is create the project.

```bash
dotnet new webapi -o api
```

Then we want to add this new project to our solution

```bash
dotnet sln mlnetacidemo.sln add api/api.csproj
```

### Adding Dependencies

Because we'll be loading our model and making predictions via our API, we need to add the `ML.NET` package to our `api` project.

```bash
cd api
dotnet add package Microsoft.ML
dotnet restore
```

### Referencing Our Model

In the previous step when we built our machine learning model, it was saved to a file called `model.zip`. This is the file we'll be referencing in our API to help us make predictions. To reference it in our API, simply copy it from the model project directory into our `api` project directory.

### Creating Data Models

Our model was built using data structures `IrisData` and `IrisPrediction` to define the features as well as the predicted attribute. Therefore, when our model makes predictions via our API, it needs to reference these data types as well. As a result, we need to define `IrisData` and `IrisPrediction` classes inside of our `api` project. The contents of the classes will be nearly identical to those in the `model` project with the only exception of our namespace changing from `model` to `api`.

```csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Api;

namespace api
{
    public class IrisData
    {
        [Column("0")]
        public float SepalLength;

        [Column("1")]
        public float SepalWidth;

        [Column("2")]
        public float PetalLength;
        
        [Column("3")]
        public float PetalWidth;

        [Column("4")]
        [ColumnName("Label")]
        public string Label;
    }    
}
```

```csharp
using Microsoft.ML.Runtime.Api;

namespace api
{
    public class IrisPrediction
    {
        [ColumnName("PredictedLabel")]
        public string PredictedLabels;
    }
}
```

### Building Endpoints

Now that our project is set up, it's time to add a controller that will handle prediction requests from the client. In the `Controllers` directory of our `api` project we can create a new class called `PredictController` with a single `POST` endpoint. The contents of the file should look like the code below:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.ML;

namespace api.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class PredictController : Controller
    {
        // POST api/predict
        [HttpPost]
        public string Post([FromBody] IrisData instance)
        {
            var model = PredictionModel.ReadAsync&lt;IrisData,IrisPrediction&gt;("model.zip").Result;
            var prediction = model.Predict(instance);
            return prediction.PredictedLabels;
        }
    }
}
```

### Testing The API

Once our `predict` endpoint is set up, it's time to test it. From the root directory of our `mlnetacidemo` solution, enter the following command.

```bash
dotnet run -p api/api.csproj
```

In a client like POSTMAN or Insomnia, send an HHTP POST request to the endpoint `http://localhost:5000/api/predict`.

The body our request should look similar to the snippet below:

```json
{
	"SepalLength": 3.3,
	"SepalWidth": 1.6,
	"PetalLength": 0.2,
	"PetalWidth": 5.1,
}
```

If successful, the output returned should equal `Iris-virginica` just like our console application.

## Packaging The Application

Great! Now that our application is successfully running locally, it's time to package it up into a Docker container and push it to Docker Hub.

### Creating The Dockerfile

In our `mlnetacidemo` solution directory, create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.0-sdk AS build
WORKDIR /app

# copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY *.sln .
COPY api/*.csproj ./api/
RUN dotnet restore

# copy everything else and build app
COPY api/. ./api/
WORKDIR /app/api
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o out


FROM microsoft/aspnetcore:2.0 AS runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY api/model.zip .
COPY --from=build /app/api/out ./
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "api.dll"]
```

### Building Our Image

To build the image, we need to enter the following command into the command prompt. This make take a while because it needs to download the .NET Core SDK and ASP.NET Core runtime Docker images.

```bash
docker build -t &lt;DOCKERUSERNAME&gt;/&lt;IMAGENAME&gt;:latest .
```

### Test Image Locally

We need to test our image locally to make sure it can run on the cloud. To do so, we can use the `docker run` command. 

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:80 &lt;DOCKERUSERNAME&gt;/&lt;IMAGENAME&gt;:latest
```

Although the API is exposing port 80, we bind it to the local port 5000 just to keep our prior API request intact. When sending a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/api/predict` with the appropriate body, the response should again equal `Iris-virginica`.

To stop the container, use `Ctrl + C`.

### Push to Docker Hub

Now that the Docker image is successfully running locally, it's time to push to Docker Hub. Again, we use the Docker CLI to do this.

```bash
docker login
docker push &lt;DOCKERUSERNAME&gt;/&lt;IMAGENAME&gt;:latest
```

## Deploying To The Cloud

Now comes the final step which is to deploy and expose our machine learning model and API to the world. Our deployment will occur via Azure Container Instances because it requires almost no provisioning or management of servers. 

### Prepare Deployment Manifest

Although deployments can be performed inline in the command line, it's usually best to place all the configurations in a file for documentation and to save time not having to type in the parameters every time. With Azure, we can do that via a JSON file. 

```json
{
  "$schema":
    "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "containerGroupName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "mlnetacicontainergroup",
      "metadata": {
        "description": "Container Group name."
      }
    }
  },
  "variables": {
    "containername": "mlnetacidemo",
    "containerimage": "&lt;DOCKERUSERNAME&gt;/&lt;IMAGENAME&gt;:latest"
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "[parameters('containerGroupName')]",
      "type": "Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups",
      "apiVersion": "2018-04-01",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "properties": {
        "containers": [
          {
            "name": "[variables('containername')]",
            "properties": {
              "image": "[variables('containerimage')]",
              "resources": {
                "requests": {
                  "cpu": 1,
                  "memoryInGb": 1.5
                }
              },
              "ports": [
                {
                  "port": 80
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        ],
        "osType": "Linux",
        "ipAddress": {
          "type": "Public",
          "ports": [
            {
              "protocol": "tcp",
              "port": "80"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "outputs": {
    "containerIPv4Address": {
      "type": "string",
      "value":
        "[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups/', parameters('containerGroupName'))).ipAddress.ip]"
    }
  }
}
```

It's a lot to look at but for now we can use this template and save it to the file `azuredeploy.json` in the root directory of our `mlnetacidemo` solution. The only thing that needs to be changed is the value of the `containerimage` property. Replace it with your Docker Hub username and the name of the image you just pushed to Docker Hub.

### Deploy

In order to deploy our application we need to make sure to log into our Azure account. To do so via the Azure CLI, type into the command prompt:

```bash
az login
```

Follow the prompts to log in. Once logged in, it's time to create a resource group for our container.

```bash
az group create --name mlnetacidemogroup --location eastus
```

After the group has been successfully created it's time to deploy our application.

```bash
az group deployment create --resource-group mlnetacidemogroup --template-file azuredeploy.json
```

Give it a few minutes for your deployment to initialize. If the deployment was successful, you should see some output on the command line. Look for the `ContainerIPv4Address` property. This is the IP Address where your container is accessible. In POSTMAN or Insomnia, replace the URL to which you previously made a POST request to with `http://&lt;ContainerIPv4Address&gt;/api/predict` where `ContainerIPv4Address` is the value that was returned to the command line after the deployment. If successful, the response should be just like previous requests `Iris-virginica`.

Once you're finished, you can clean up resources with the following command:

```bash
az group delete --name mlnetacidemogroup
```

## Conclusion

In this writeup, we built a classification machine learning model using `ML.NET` that predicts the class of an iris plant given four measurement features, exposed it via an ASP.NET Core REST API, packaged it into a container and deployed it to the cloud using Azure Container Instances. As the model changes and becomes more complex, the process is standardized enough that extending this example would require minimal changes to our existing application. Happy Coding!

      <title>E2E Dockerizing a MEAN Stack Application</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[

## Introduction

Lately I've been getting familiar with [Docker](https://docker.com). I have built single container applications using a `Dockerfile` and run them locally. This works fine, especially for deployment purposes to a production VM but it's no different than setting up the VM with all the required dependencies and pushing updates via FTP or source control. However, one of the features that I have found extremely useful is multi-container building and deployment via `docker-compose`. With `docker-compose`, not only can I build and run my application, but also dependent services like databases, caches, proxies, etc. Best of all, the builds are standardized and initialized at once without having to individually install the dependencies and components. This writeup explores how to containerize a MEAN stack application and set up a `docker-compose.yml` file for it to build and start the server and database services defined within it.

## Requirements

This writeup assumes that `Docker`, `Docker-Compose` and `Node` are installed on your PC. 

## The Application

The application is a CRUD todo MEAN stack application. The repo for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/lqdev/todomeandockerdemo).

### Project Structure

```text
|_models (Mongoose models)
| |_todo.model.js
|_public
| |_scripts
| | |_controllers
| | | |_main.controller.js
| | |_services
| |   |_todo.service.js
| |_views
| | |_main.html
| |_app.js (front-end application)
| |_index.html
|_Dockerfile (server service)
|_docker-compose.yml
|_api.js (todo api routes)
|_config.js
|_server.js (back-end application)
```

The front-end is built with `AngularJS` and the back-end is built with `NodeJS` using the `Express` web framework and `MongoDB` database. `MongoDB` models are defined with the `Mongoose` package. In the application, users can create, view, update and delete todo tasks. The `Dockerfile` is used to define the container for the web application and the `docker-compose.yml` defines both the `MongoDB` database container as well as the web application container defined in the `Dockerfile`.

## The Docker File

```docker
#Define base image
FROM node:8

#Set Working Directory
WORKDIR /app

#Copy pakage.json file from current directory to working directory
ADD package.json /app

#Install npm packages
RUN npm install

#Copy all application files from local directory to working directory
ADD . /app

#Open port where app will be listening
EXPOSE 3000

#Start application
CMD ['npm','start']
```

### Define Docker Image and Application Directory

The `Dockerfile` has no extension and the syntax is like a standard text file. `#` characters denote comments. `Docker` works based off images which are basically pre-built packages that are stored in one of many registries such as `DockerHub`. `DockerHub` can be thought of as a package repository/manager like `npm` or `dpkg`. In the first two lines of the file we define which base image we want to create our container with. Since this is a MEAN stack application built entirely in `JavaScript`, we'll be using the `node` version 8 image. Then we want set the directory in which our application will reside. We do this by using the `WORKDIR` command and setting `/app` as our application directory, but any directory of your choosing is valid.

### Install Dependecies

All of our dependencies should be defined in our `package.json` file. In order to install these dependencies in our container, we need to copy our local `package.json` file into our container application directory. This can be done with the `ADD` command by passing the `package.json` and application directory `/app` as arguments. Once that file has been copied, it's time to install the dependencies. To run commands through the build process of the application we use the `RUN` command. The command is no different than the one you'd use on your local machine. Therefore, to install the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file we use the command `RUN npm install`.

### Copy Application Files

Once our dependencies are installed, we need to copy the rest of the files in our local project directory to our container application directory. Like with the `package.json` file we use the `ADD` command and pass `.` and `/app` as our source and destination arguments respectively.

#### .dockerignore

Something to keep in mind is that locally we have a `node_modules` directory containing our installed dependencies. In the previous step, we ran the `npm install` command which will create the `node_modules` directory inside our container. Therefore, there is no need to copy all these files over. Like `git`, we can set up a `.dockerignore` file which will contain the files and directory to be ignored by `Docker` when packaging and building the container. The `.dockerignore` file looks like the following.

```text
node_modules/*
```

### Opening Ports

Our application will be listening for connections on a port. This particular application will use port 3000. We need to define the port to listen on in the `Dockerfile` as well. To do so, we'll use the `EXPOSE` command and pass the port(s) that the application will listen on. (MongoDB listens on 27017, but since the `Dockerfile` only deals with the web application and not the database we only need to specify the web application's port).

### Starting the Application

After our container is set up, dependencies are installed and port is defined, it's time to start our application. Unlike the process of running commands while building the container using the `RUN` command, we'll use the `CMD` command to start our application. The arguments accepted by this are an array of strings. In this case, we start our application like we would locally by typing in `npm start`. The `Dockerfile` command to start our application is the following `CMD ['npm','start']`.

## The docker-compose.yml File

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  db:
    image: mongo
    ports: 
      - 27017:27017
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    links:
      - "db"
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file is a way of defining, building and starting multi-container applications using `docker-compose`. In our case we have a two container application, one of the containers is the web application we defined and built in the `Dockerfile` and the other is a `MongoDB` database. The `docker-compose.yml` file can take many options, but the only ones we'll be using are the `version` and `services` option. The `version` option defines which syntax version of the `docker-compose.yml` file we'll be using. In our case we'll be using version 2. The `services` option defines the individual containers to be packaged and initialized.

### Services

As mentioned, we have two containers. The names of our containers are `web` and `db`. These names can be anything you want, as long as they're descriptive and make sense to you. The `web` container will be our web application and the `db` container will be our `MongoDB` database. Notice that we have listed our `db` service first and then our `web` service. The reason for this is we want to build and initialize our database prior to our application so that by the time that the web application is initialized, it's able to successfully connect to the database. If done the other way around, an error will be thrown because the database will not be listening for connections and the web application won't be able to connect. Another way to ensure that our database is initialized prior to our web application is to use the `links` option in our `web` service and add the name of the database service `db` to the list of dependent services. The `ports` option like in our `Dockerfile` defines which ports that container will need to operate. In this case, our `web` app listens on port 3000 and the `db` service will listen on port 27017.

#### Container Images

The `docker-compose.yml` can build containers based on images hosted in a registry as well as those defined by a `Dockerfile`. To use images from a registry, we use the `image` option inside of our service. Take the `db` service for example. `MongoDB` already has an image in the `DockerHub` registry which we will use to build the container. Our `web` container does not have an image that is listed in a registry. However, we can still build an image based off a `Dockerfile`. To do this, we use the `build` option inside our service and pass the directory of the respective `Dockerfile` containing the build instructions for the container. 

## Building and Running Containers

Now that our container definitions and files are set up, we're ready to build and run our application. This can be done by typing `docker-compose up -d` in the terminal from inside our local project directory. The `-d` option runs the command detached allowing us to continue using the terminal. This command will both build and start our containers simultaneously. Once the `web` and `db` containers are up and running, we can visit `http://localhost:3000` from our browser to view and test our application. To stop the application, inside the local project directory, we can type `docker-compose stop` in our terminal to stop both containers.

## Conclusion

This writeup uses a pre-configured MEAN stack CRUD todo application and explores how to define a single container `Dockerfile` as well as a multi-container application using `docker-compose`. Docker streamlines how applications are built and deployed while `docker-compose` allows more complex multi-container applications to be orchestrated, linked, deployed and managed simultaneously allowing developers to spend more time  developing solutions and less time managing infrastructure and dependencies.
