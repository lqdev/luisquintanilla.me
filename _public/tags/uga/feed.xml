      <title>Orange Bowl 2023 - the playoff game that never was</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;So basically this Orange Bowl game between Georgia and Florida State is a look at what the College Football Playoff could've been, had both teams been part of the playoff. I know teams in general were affected by the transfer portal, but it's not even close. It's barely halftime but the game is basically over unless Florida State finds a way to score 6 touchdowns in the next 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
