      <title>Apple M3 Announced</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Apple unveiled their &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/"&gt;M3 family of chips&lt;/a&gt; and new devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, The Verge always does a great job covering and condensing these events into a short video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN8oCWGeRtI" title="Apple Scary Fast Event - The Verge"&gt;&lt;img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/gN8oCWGeRtI/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Apple Scary Fast Event - The Verge" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial impressions of the anouncement, this is why Apple wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited by the Snapdragon announcement last week. However, as I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/posts/quick-thoughts-snapdragon-summit-2023"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;quot;the biggest miss from Qualcomm and Windows partners today was not having a lineup of devices ready for purchase&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn't the case for Apple. Not only did they announce their new chips but they also announced devices which will be available as late as the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand Apple owns the entire process so they can align their chip and device announcements. However, Qualcomm brought out many partners on stage. Unless I missed it, I don't remember seeing any PC announcements that would be ready for purchase within the next 2-3 months.&lt;/p&gt;
