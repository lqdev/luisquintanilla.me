      <title>AI Subtitles Are Coming to VLC</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shown off at CES 2025 is VLC's upcoming automatic subtitling feature, which is local in nature, running entirely on a user's machine without needing to connect to some distant server.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
According to Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the creator and lead developer of VLC, this new feature is powered by open source AI models, which carry out subtitle generation tasks in two stages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One aspect is automatic generation of subtitles from the video, and the other is translation of those subtitles into over 100 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there's no word on when this feature will be arriving on VLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>How do you watch Blu-Ray on PC?</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have a preference for physical media. There's many reasons, some related to the sentiment of &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/responses/landlord-of-your-notes"&gt;owning vs. renting content&lt;/a&gt;. Along the same lines, streaming services and service providers can change the terms of service and you have little to no control over it. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)"&gt;Westworld&lt;/a&gt; is an example of that. One day, HBO decided to pull it from its streaming service and physical copies were the only way you could watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to my most recent experience trying to play a Blu-Ray disc on my PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I decided to sit down to watch an episode of Westworld. Usually, I get the DVD version. In this case though, I had the Blu-Ray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an external Blu-Ray player so I thought, &amp;quot;Great! Let me just plug that into my laptop and start the show&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I thought was a simple task, ended up taking me about 20 minutes to figure out and even then I got to a subpar solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer playing media either with MPV or VLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it wouldn't play so I decided to go online and figure out why. Turns out, that's not supported out of the box and to get it working you need to download an additional DLL and &lt;a href="https://www.easefab.com/resource/play-blu-ray-with-vlc.html"&gt;configure a few things in the VLC settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could've gone through that process, but I just wanted to watch a show. There's got to be an easier way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I turned to the built-in Media Player in Windows. No luck there either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going with the &lt;a href="https://www.leawo.com/blu-ray-player/"&gt;Leawo Blu-Ray player&lt;/a&gt;. Although it's free, you have to deal with pop-ups prompting you to upgrade to the paid version. It works though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to use VLC or the built-in media player but it's unfortunate using them isn't as straightforward. Now that I have some more time, I'll set up VLC so that next time, it can &amp;quot;just work&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll close it out with a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you watch Blu-Rays on your PC?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/contact"&gt;Send me a message&lt;/a&gt; and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The lqvlc network protocol</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Introduction

Whether it's videos, online radio, podcasts, or my personal music collection, VLC is my default player. I especially enjoy the ability of playing an online audio or video stream using the URL. What I don't like about that process is that I usually have to manually copy the link and use either the terminal or graphical user interface to play the stream. While not a large number of additional steps, it's still not ideal. The experience I would like is to automatically launch VLC whenever I click a link to an audio or video stream. That's possible using custom network protocols in Firefox. In this guide, I'll show how I defined and configured my own protocol (lqvlc) in Firefox to automatically launch VLC. 

## Prerequisites

- VLC
- Firefox

This guide was built to work on unix systems. However, setting up something similar with a PowerShell or CMD script on Windows should work similarly. 

## Network protocols

A network protocol defines how data is exchanged and transferred over a network. Some common protocols are HTTP, FTP, and SSH. In the context of browsers, the most common protocol is HTTP and the way the browser identifies the protocol is based on the scheme portion of the URL. So for the website [http://lqdev.me](http://lqdev.me), http is the scheme that tells the browser which protocol to use. For more information on network protocols and URLs, see the article [What is a URL?](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

Firefox has a set of standard protocols like HTTP that are configured out of the box. However, you have the option of configuring a custom protocol. 

## What is the lqvlc protocol

Now that you have a general idea of what network protocols are and how browsers handle them, it's time to introduce the lqvlc protocol. The intent of the lqvlc protocol is to automatically take a URL from an online audio or video stream and launch it in VLC. lqvlc protocol URLs use lqvlc as the scheme instead of http. 

For example:

&lt;table class="table"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Original Audio Stream Link&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;lqvlc Link&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="https://somafm.com/u80s64.pls"&gt;https://somafm.com/u80s64.pls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="lqvlc://somafm.com/u80s64.pls"&gt;lqvlc://somafm.com/u80s64.pls&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;    
&lt;/table&gt;

You'll notice the only difference is the scheme. That's enough information for the browser to know, lqvlc is a protocol I need to handle in some way. In the next sections, I'll describe what you need to do to get Firefox to recognize and handle the lqvlc protocol. 

## Configure network protocols in Firefox

To configure a custom network protocol

1. Launch Firefox
1. In the address bar, navigate to `about:config` and select **Accept the Risk and continue**. As the warning mentions, these are advanced configurations so proceed with caution.
1. Add the following configuration preferences:

    &lt;table class="table"&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Configuration Preference&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;network.protocol-handler.expose.lqvlc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Boolean&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;                            
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;network.protocol-handler.external.lqvlc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Boolean&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;i&gt;network.protocol-handler.warn-external.lqvlc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Boolean&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    ![Firefox lqvlc network protocol handler configuration preferences](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11130940/177898847-79cce773-9275-4e4d-8e7c-a6b5fbfe8f48.png)


    The last two tell Firefox to let an external application handle files with the protocol you've defined. In this case, that's `lqvlc`. If you're configuring your own protocol, you'd replace the lqvlc in the configuration preference with your own.

## Create a handler

Now that Firefox knows that it must use an external application to handle lqvlc URLs, it's time to configure the handler. The easiest way to create a handler is to use a bash script. 

1. Create a new file called *lqvlc-handler.sh* with the following content:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    link=$1

    vlc "${link/lqvlc/http}"
    ```

    The script takes the first argument it's passed, an lqvlc URL, replaces the scheme with `http`, and launches it in VLC.

1. Make the file executable. In the terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    chmod +x lqvlc-handler.sh
    ```

That's it! Now you just need to test it out. 

## Test it out

To use it for your own purposes, you'd have to create or update an HTML page and set the `href` in your anchor tags to use `lqvlc` instead of `http`. However, I've already configured lqvlc links in my own website. If you go to the [radio page](/radio) on my website, you can click on any of the lqvlc links. Alternatively, You can also click on the link to the [SOMA FM Underground 80's station lqvlc link](lqvlc://somafm.com/u80s64.pls). A prompt will pop up asking you to choose which app you want to use to handle the link. Select the lqvlc-handler.sh script you created. If everything is configured correctly, VLC should launch and the radio stations should start playing. 

## Next Steps

Although I've gotten this working for my personal site, I'd like to be able to use the lqvlc protocol in any website I visit that has links to audio and video streams. Arguably, I can also launch lqvlc links from other websites. However, that would require website owners to configure them. The next step I think to make that happen would be to create an Add-On that automatically rewrites stream links to use the lqvlc protocol. ]]&gt;</description>

      <title>How to listen to internet radio using VLC</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Introduction

Music streaming services like Spotify generally do a good job of making recommendations based on your music tastes. By applying algorithms to your listening history, they're able to provide you with a listening experience tailored to you. When it comes to music discovery though, it can be difficult to find new music so you often end up listening to music that sounds very similar. Internet radio can help expose you to music you otherwise wouldn't normally listen to. Radio stations like those on [SomaFM](https://somafm.com/) provide a wide variety of high quality music channels. There's other online radio stations out there, many which provide a built-in audio player. As I've written in previous posts though ([How to watch Twitch streams using VLC](/posts/how-to-watch-twitch-using-vlc/) &amp; [Podcast management with RSS &amp; VLC](/notes/rss-vlc-podcast-management)), VLC is a versatile tool. As a result, it's no surprise you can also use it to listen to online radio streams. This post is mostly a note to myself, but I encourage you to try it as well. 

## Prerequisites

- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/index.html)

The commands below were run on Linux. Since VLC is cross-platform, the same commands should work on those platforms as well. 

## Listen to internet radio

The first thing you'll need is the URL of the stream you want to listen to. Usually it's provided on the station's website. You can also browse through [RadioBrowser](https://www.radio-browser.info/) to find a station and its stream URL.

Once you have the URL, in the terminal, enter the following command:

```bash
vlc &lt;STREAM-URL&gt;
```

Replace `&lt;STREAM-URL&gt;` with the address of your stream.

After a few seconds, VLC launches and your stream should start playing.

If you prefer to stream audio without VLC's visual interface, use the following command.

```bash
cvlc &lt;STREAM-URL&gt;
```

Note that without the UI you won't have access to any playback controls. 

Happy listening!

      <title>Podcast management with RSS and VLC</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I've written before about how &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/posts/rediscovering-rss-user-freedom/"&gt;versatile the RSS protocol is for publishing and consuming content&lt;/a&gt;. Podcasts are one of the many media types that largely rely on RSS, making it easy to subscribe and manage using an RSS client of your choice. Like RSS, &lt;a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/"&gt;VLC&lt;/a&gt; is versatile in the type of media it can play. When you combine the two, you're able to stay updated on the latest episodes from your favorite podcasts using the RSS reader of your choice and use the episode's URL to stream the audio in VLC.&lt;/p&gt;
