      <title>The Return of the Cassette Tape</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[star] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of cassettes are up more than &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/07/nx-s1-4976071/the-cassette-tape-is-making-a-comeback-thanks-to-a-family-run-company-in-missouri"&gt;440 percent&lt;/a&gt; over the past decade. Cassette players (think modernized Walkmans) are also back, with companies producing new versions of this decidedly retro tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “revenge of analog,”...is motivated by a combination of factors, from the practical to the more prosaic, and, ultimately, a more mindful use of technology. This approach rejects a binary of good vs. bad tech, and instead seeks a via media — a middle path — with its daily use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I haven't done it as much with music, over the past few years I've been slowly rebuilding my analog media collection which includes movies and books. As the article mentions, part of that is ownership and actually owning the things I pay for. More importantly though, rather than scrolling through an endless catalog and never finding something to watch or read, I have a curated set of items to enjoy in a more mindful manner. If I feel the need to scroll through an endless catalog, there's always the library which has tons of media available. I find the library to be a heavily underutilized and almost forgotten community service we've all already paid for in some way, so why not use it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cassette tape is making a comeback</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the odds, cassette tapes are making a comeback. And one family-owned company in Springfield, Missouri is a leader in the revival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this also means that players are also making a comeback because you need something to play them on. Having visited a museum recently full of old radio recordings on cassette tapes, I was sad to find out I couldn't listen to them because the tape player was broken. It's hard enough finding a decent MP3 player, I'm sure it must be just as hard if not harder finding a tape player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between this article and &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/responses/dumbphone-boom-real"&gt;The Dumbphone Boom is Real&lt;/a&gt;, I'm seeing more publications on the subject. Far from a comeback, but still cool to see.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘PBS Retro’ is coming to Roku as a FAST channel</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[star] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBS is making child edutainment classics like Zoboomafoo, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, and Reading Rainbow available for free on a new ‘PBS Retro’ channel on Roku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is cool! Although I'm kind of bummed the stuff I grew up watching is now considered &amp;quot;retro&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AI like it's 1999 or 1899</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Introduction

In an earlier note, I talked about the natural progression of technology which goes from [scarcity to abundance](/notes/ai-abundance-scarcity-cycle-repeats-rss-enclosure-use-case) over time and AI is no different. That was in the context of media on the internet and paying per minute with early cell phones. One of the original challenges with AI was context length and token limits. It's becoming less relevant as context sizes continue to increase. However, it's not like you can fit the entire Harry Potter series either. So you still need to cleverly manage your context size especially when using documents and chat history as part of that context. Historically, people have used abbreviations to compress messages either because of cost or medium constraints. That's what this post explores in the context of AI.

## Compressing text like T9

Below is a conversation Microsoft Copilot (formerly Bing Chat) using some information from the article [From 1890: The First Text Messages](https://sundaymagazine.org/2010/08/10/from-1890-the-first-text-messages/):

&gt; **Me** 
&gt; &gt; Summarize this text:
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; I’m trying something new today. Sometimes in my research I find an interesting old article that I wouldn’t normally post because it’s not from the Sunday Magazine section, or it’s from further than 100 years ago so I’ll never get to it. Instead of letting these go unused, I figure I’ll occasionally post them midweek during what would otherwise be slow weeks. Since this weekend I only have three articles to post, it seems like a good week to try it.
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; Telegraph operators on opposite sides of the country had some time to get to know each other when they weren’t busy sending other people’s messages. “Metaphorically they shake hands cordially twice a day — when they begin work and when they end it. And when business is dull they hold long conversations, with hundreds of miles — perhaps thousands — separating them, as two friends might do over a dinner table.”
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; What really caught my eye, though, is that the abbreviations they used seem a lot like the abbreviations used in today’s text messages.
&gt; 
&gt; **Copilot**
&gt; &gt; Here is a possible summary of the text:
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; The author is trying a new feature of posting old articles from the Sunday Magazine section on midweek. The article is about how telegraph operators communicated with each other using abbreviations that are similar to today’s text messages. The author finds this interesting and wonders if there are other similarities between old and new forms of communication.
&gt; 
&gt; **Me**
&gt; &gt; Now abbreviate it as if using a T9 keyboard for conciseness
&gt; 
&gt; **Copilot**
&gt; &gt; That sounds like a fun challenge. Here is a possible abbreviation of the summary:
&gt; &gt;   
&gt; &gt; try new feat post old artcls midwk. artcl abt telgrph oprtrs chat w/ abbrvtns lk txt msgs. find intrstng n wndr othr smilrts btwn old n new comms.

In this conversation, I first had Copilot summarize the original text. It's not a very long piece of text but it works for this example. You could imagine though how a longer piece of text would benefit even more from this summarization. Copilot does a good job of summarizing the text. However, what if I wanted to summarize it even more? 

In comes T9 (kind of). T9 is short for "Text on 9 keys" and it was predictive text technology that made it easier to compose SMS text messages using only the 9 keys on the phone keypad. Before T9, it was cumbersome and time consuming to compose full sentences so you might abbreviate them. For example "See you later" might be abbreviated as "c u l8r". You can learn more in the [SMS language Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_language). Not only would you abbreviate because it was tedious to compose messages one letter at a time, but also you were limited in the number of characters you could send in a single SMS. Somewhat related, in the early days of microblogging on Twitter, one of the ways you could compose and view tweets was through SMS. There was the cost aspects as well. You were charged per SMS so you wanted to send as much information in a single SMS as possible. Now SMS is only one example where this took place. Telegrams and telegraphs from yesteryear had similar constraints. Whether it was cost, size limits, or general UX challenges, people looked to abbreviations to draft their messages. 

Now that we're caught up on this history, that's what you're seeing in this response from Copilot.

&gt; try new feat post old artcls midwk. artcl abt telgrph oprtrs chat w/ abbrvtns lk txt msgs. find intrstng n wndr othr smilrts btwn old n new comms.

It is an abbreviated form of the summarized message enabling you to use even less tokens as part of the prompts you submit to AI. 

When looking at "word" counts, they are roughly the following:

| Text | Word Count |
| --- | --- |
| Original | 58 |
| Summarized | 25 |
| T9 | 18 |

We can see that the abbreviated version is ~3x smaller than the original message. 

## Conclusion

Given that models like GPT and others have been trained on the entire internet, it has some knowledge of these types of abbreviations to compose messages. Now, is it scalable and would you want to use this in your production applications, I can't say. Probably not because the abbreviations are lossy. While in general you could read and get the gist of the message using the abbreviations, there are things lost in translation. Now maybe the LLM might do a better job at interpreting the abbreviations. It'd be a fun experiment. 

"n d mntm, il kp usng AI lk its 1999. c u l8r!"

Translation: "In the meantime, I'll keep using AI like it's 1999. See you later!" :slightly_smiling_face:]]&gt;</description>

      <title>DOS_deck</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOS_deck is built upon the foundation of JS-DOS, which, in turn, relies on DOSBox. Together, they breathe new life into MS-DOS games by bringing them to your browser. However, there's a twist. Games from that era were designed for keyboard and mouse input, without established standards for interaction or control patterns. Here at DOS_deck, a tremendous effort was put into creating a seamless experience, enabling you to effortlessly navigate and play these games, ideally with the comfort of a controller in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[bookmark] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graphical Unix-like operating system for desktop computers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SerenityOS is a love letter to '90s user interfaces with a custom Unix-like core. It flatters with sincerity by stealing beautiful ideas from various other systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, the goal is a marriage between the aesthetic of late-1990s productivity software and the power-user accessibility of late-2000s *nix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a system by us, for us, based on the things we like.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Newspapers, CDs, and MP3 players - Am I in 2006?</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;While flipping through a local (physical) newspaper, I came across an ad for a sale happening at a nearby record store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/newspaper_ad.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Newpaper ad for a memorial day CD and vinyl sale" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having nothing planned, I decided to check it out and ended up with a nice haul of about 15 CDs and 2 DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/cds_mp3.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="3 CDs on a wooden table with an portable MP3 player" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fired up my &lt;a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-8x-external-usb-double-layer-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-black/5852919.p?skuId=5852919"&gt;portable CD/DVD drive&lt;/a&gt; to transfer my new purchases to my &lt;a href="https://www.fiio.com/m6"&gt;portable MP3 player&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once finished, I popped one of the DVDs into the drive, made popcorn, and settled in. If I didn't know any better, this could easily be a scene from 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
