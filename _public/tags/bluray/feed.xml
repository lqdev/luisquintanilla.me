      <title>How do you watch Blu-Ray on PC?</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I have a preference for physical media. There's many reasons, some related to the sentiment of &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/responses/landlord-of-your-notes"&gt;owning vs. renting content&lt;/a&gt;. Along the same lines, streaming services and service providers can change the terms of service and you have little to no control over it. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)"&gt;Westworld&lt;/a&gt; is an example of that. One day, HBO decided to pull it from its streaming service and physical copies were the only way you could watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to my most recent experience trying to play a Blu-Ray disc on my PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day I decided to sit down to watch an episode of Westworld. Usually, I get the DVD version. In this case though, I had the Blu-Ray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an external Blu-Ray player so I thought, &amp;quot;Great! Let me just plug that into my laptop and start the show&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I thought was a simple task, ended up taking me about 20 minutes to figure out and even then I got to a subpar solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer playing media either with MPV or VLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, it wouldn't play so I decided to go online and figure out why. Turns out, that's not supported out of the box and to get it working you need to download an additional DLL and &lt;a href="https://www.easefab.com/resource/play-blu-ray-with-vlc.html"&gt;configure a few things in the VLC settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could've gone through that process, but I just wanted to watch a show. There's got to be an easier way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I turned to the built-in Media Player in Windows. No luck there either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up going with the &lt;a href="https://www.leawo.com/blu-ray-player/"&gt;Leawo Blu-Ray player&lt;/a&gt;. Although it's free, you have to deal with pop-ups prompting you to upgrade to the paid version. It works though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer to use VLC or the built-in media player but it's unfortunate using them isn't as straightforward. Now that I have some more time, I'll set up VLC so that next time, it can &amp;quot;just work&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll close it out with a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you watch Blu-Rays on your PC?&lt;/p&gt;
