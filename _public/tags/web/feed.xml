      <title>Mobile-First Static Site Publishing: Discord Bot Pipeline via Azure and GitHub</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## The problem

Ever since I published my [first note](/notes/hello-world)([microblog post](https://indieweb.org/note)) on my website, I've always wanted a way to quickly publish while on the go. Unfortunately, I never found a good solution. 

Because my website is statically generated and the source is hosted on GitHub(check out the [colophon](/colophon) for more details), there is no backend for me to talk to. At the same time, I didn't want to build an entire backend to support my website because I want to keep things as lean and cost-efficient as possible. 

Since my posts are just frontmatter and Markdown, I [use VS Code as my editor](/uses). For some time, back when I used to have a Surface Duo, I [authored posts from mobile using the github.dev experience](https://www.lqdev.me/notes/surface-duo-blogging-github-dev). On two screens, while not ideal, it was manageable. After switching devices (because sadly there were no more security updates on the Surface Duo) and upgrading to a dumbphone and later a single screen smartphone, that workflow wasn't feasible.

At that point, what I resorted to was sending messages to myself via [Element](https://element.io/). The message would contain a link I wanted to check out later. Once I was on my laptop, I would check out the link and if I wanted to post about it on my website, I'd do so then. 

That process, while it worked, wasn't necessarily scalable. In part that's a feature because I could spend more time digesting the content and writing a thoughtful article. However, it stopped me from sharing more in the moment and there were posts that were never authored or bookmarks that weren't captured because eventually that link got lost in the river of other links. 

Basically what I wanted to replicate was the more instant posting that social media gives you, but do so on my own site. 

That led me to doing some thinking and requirement gathering around the type of experience I wanted to have.

## Requirements

When it came to requirements for my solution, I was focused more on the workflow and experience rather on technical details. 

Here is a list of those solution requirements:

- Mobile is the primary publishing interface. Desktop publishing is a nice to have.
- Be as low-friction as sharing a link via Element or posting on social media
- Doesn't require implementing my own client or frontend
- Doesn't require me to use existing micropub clients
- Handles short-form and media posts supported by my website
    - Notes
    - Responses
        - Repost
        - Reply
        - Like
    - Bookmark
    - Media
        - Image
        - Audio (not used as often but technically supported)
        - Video (not used as often but technically supported)
- Low-cost

## The solution

For years, I had been struggling with actually implementing this system. The main part that gave me pause was not implementing my own client or relying on existing micropub clients. 

Eventually, I just accepted that it might never happen. 

One day, it eventually hit me. If the notes to self Element workflow worked so well, why not use a chat client as the frontend for publishing. At least have it serve as the capture system that would then format the content into a post that gets queued for publishing on GitHub. I'd seen [Benji do something similar with his micropub endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-micropub). 

While I could've used Element since that's my preferred platform, I've been contemplating no longer hosting my own Matrix server. So if I went through with this, I'd want something that I didn't feel bad about investing the time on this solution if that chat client went away. 

That then left me with Discord as the next best option. Primarily because of its support for bots as well as its cross-platform support across mobile and desktop. 

In the end, the solution then ended up being fairly straightforward. 

More importantly, with the help of AI, I wrote none of the code. 

Using Copilot and Claude Sonnet 4, I was able to go from idea to deployment in 1-2 days. At that time the solution supported all of the posts except for media which I hadn't figured out what the best way of uploading media through Discord was. Figuring that out, implementing it, and deploying it took another day or two. 

Since I wanted for my solution to be as low-cost as possible, serverless seemed like a good option. I only pay for compute when it's actually being used which can be infrequent in my case. I don't need the server running 24/7 or even to be powerful. However, I didn't want to write my system as an Azure Function. I wanted the flexibility of deploying on a shared VM or container. A VM though wasn't an option since it's running 24/7. Keeping all of that in mind, my choice was narrowed down to Azure Container Apps which gave me the characteristics I was looking for. Serverless containers. 

Once that decision was made, I used Copilot again to figure out how to optimize my container image so that it's space and resource efficient. And while at it, I used Copilot again to figure out the right incantations to get the container deployed to Azure Container Apps. 

All-in-all, the solution had been staring at me in the face since I already had a workflow that for the most part worked for me, it just needed some optimizations and with the help of AI, I was able to quickly build and deploy something I'd been ruminating over for years.  

## Workflow

The workflow for publishing is as follows:

1. Invoke the bot in Discord to capture my input using slash command `/post` and the respective post type.

    ![Using slash commands to invoke discord publishing bot](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/invoke-discord-publishing-bot.png)

1. Provide post details. For media posts, I can provide an attachment which gets uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.

    ![A modal in discord with note post fields filled in](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/discord-publishing-client-modal.png)

1. [Bot creates a branch and PR in my repo](https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/pull/152) with the post content
1. While logged into GitHub from my phone, if everything looks good, I merge the PR which kicks off my GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish the site including the new post. 
1. Post [displays on my website](/media/test-media-post-from-mobile/).

## Challenges

The solution is not perfect. 

One of the problems I've run into is cold-start. Since I scale my solution down to zero when it's not being used to save on costs, I suffer from the cold start problem. Therefore, when I first invoke the bot, it fails. I have to give it a few seconds and retry the invocation. It's usually about 5 seconds so it's not a huge issue but it does add some friction. 

## Next steps

Overall I'm happy with my solution but there are a few improvements I'd like to make.

- **Open-source the repo** - Currently I've kept the repo private since it was all AI generated. Since my system is already in production and processes were documented, I need to do a more thorough pass to make sure that no secrets or credentials are checked in or documented anywhere.
- **Improve UX** - Discord limits modal fields to 5. Therefore, I'm playing around with the right balance between how much of the input should come from slash commands and how much should come from the modal.
- **Expand supported post types** - I'd like to expand the number of posts supported by my publishing client. Reviews are a good example of the type of post I'd like to support as well as RSVPs. [Reviews I already support](https://www.lqdev.me/reviews) on my website but RSVPs I don't yet. Also, I'd have to fix my Webmentions which are currently broken after [upgrading my website](/notes/hello-world-new-site-2025-08/). 
- **Make it generator agnostic** - Currently this only works for my website. With a few tweaks and refactoring, I think I can get the project to a place where it should work with other popular static site generators. 
- **One-click deployment** - Currently the solution is packaged up as a container so it can be deployed from anywhere. I want to make it even simpler to deploy. One click if possible.

      <title>In Praise of Links</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[star] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperlinks deserve more recognition in light of all the ways their value has been sidelined and denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I present a link compilation in praise of links. It includes things I agree with entirely and things I don't, spanning from the 2020s to the early 2000s, to supply a tapestry of perspectives, context, and examples on the value and importance of links. Links may have their downsides, challenges, and vulnerabilities, but my hope is that this compilation will (re)invigorate your appreciation for linking as a technology and a social practice, all the better to understand what's at stake when links are discarded and devalued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>The Evolution of Blogging</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[star] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...around 1997, when Jorn Barger launched his website, titling it “The Robot Wisdom Weblog.” Barger’s plan was to curate his favorite links from around the web, and add bits of commentary to each one. In other words, he meant to keep a log of his web experience. Hence weblog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their earliest days, webloggers stood as gatekeepers to the web’s ever-growing well of content. Each day, these URL pioneers would post a few new links and sprinkle in their own commentary. Blogs acted as a signpost for web users, and following a few key blogs was enough to keep track of just about everything new on the web. Many began to look at the blogging community as a brand new type of media, one that often stood far closer to an impartial truth than traditional mediums would allow for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1999, Peter Merholz threw up his own weblog, and in the sidebar added the tagline: &amp;quot;I’ve decided to pronounce the word “weblog” as wee’- blog. Or “blog” for short.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, most bloggers hand coded their sites, adding a new HTML page to their server each time they had a new entry, or just updating the homepage to include the newest links. But soon enough, tools showed up to help bloggers with the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...on the fringes, a new type of blog was emerging. The personal blog. These sites ditched the curated links and focused exclusively on commentary. Bloggers used their site to chronicle their personal journey, from the almost boring and banal to the weird and wonderful. This new type of blog was less an alternative media source and more akin to an online journal or diary. And these writers saw themselves not as gatekeepers to the web, but as sharers of their own identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New tools soon caught up with this shifting perspective. The first of the bunch to do so was LiveJournal...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogger came next. And it would prove to be the most popular of the early blogging tools. The platform first launched in August of 1999, but picked up steam the following year when it introduced the concept of a permalink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These platforms made blogging open, in every sense of the word. Visitors were greeted with a single, open textarea on a free platform that was open to all to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogger became the platform choice for a lot of writers out there. It certainly was for Mena Trott&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trott had the feeling that platforms like Blogger did not go nearly far enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trott wanted her own site to stand out from the crowd. To be quintessentially hers. Blogger wouldn’t let her do that. So together with her husband, a Perl programmer, she built Movable Type...And with that move, Trott ushered in a third generation of blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movable Type allowed users to set up their blog on their own server, and have complete control over its look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog (the noun and verb) became a word familiar not just to web geeks, but to everyone. Lots of imitators and innovators followed in the wake of Moveable Type. Open source platforms like WordPress rose to meet the rising demand. But for a long time, Moveable Type was the standard. It fed its community with a constant stream of new features that promoted openness and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging, as a community and a practice, continues to be refined to this day thanks to the dedication of web users everywhere. But its sharpest point was made the day Mena Trott decided that &lt;strong&gt;a blog could be more than just some text on a page. It could be one of a kind.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>How I turned my blog into a social media hub</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...my blog has become a central hub for almost everything I write online, including nearly all my social media posts, links to my published work on other sites, and the occasional freestanding blog post. While this approach has a few trade-offs, I feel better about posting in the first place knowing that I’m doing it on my own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also just something deeply satisfying about seeing a running feed of my own writing, on my own website, with my own design and presentation. A social network alone can’t replicate that, but the POSSE approach offers the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've enjoyed seeing over the past few weeks, as people seek new online platforms, the personal website is being rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using my domain for discovery in Mastodon</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;For a while, I've known that I can use my domain and the WebFinger protocol to aid with discovery in the Fediverse, specifically Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried implementing this feature on my website a while back but was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, I got an itch to try it again and got it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, what I was doing wrong the first time was, I was trying to use &lt;code&gt;lqdev.me&lt;/code&gt; as the domain. Currently, my domain is not set up to use apex / naked domains. Therefore, it makes sense why that didn't work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I used &lt;code&gt;www.lqdev.me&lt;/code&gt;, everything seemed to be working fine. The implementation isn't perfect, because technically you can use any username. &lt;a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/use-your-own-user-domain-for-mastodon-discoverability-with-the-webfinger-protocol-without-hosting-a-server"&gt;Scott Hanselman does a nice job explaining that&lt;/a&gt;. The important part though is that &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/notes/now-on-bluesky"&gt;my persence on the Fediverse is now directly linked to my domain, just like it is with Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;. This goes beyond the link verification Mastodon provides. As a result, it provides more flexibility and opportunities to shape my presence on the Fediverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in implementing it for yourself, there's a ton of guides, but here's the one I used: &lt;a href="https://guide.toot.as/guide/use-your-own-domain/"&gt;Use your own user @ domain for Mastodon discoverability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like the &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain. So far I've put up with it for a while but this might be the forcing function to finally getting the apex domain setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can search my account in Mastodon using &lt;code&gt;@lqdev@www.lqdev.me&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OPML for website feeds</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;While thiking about implementing &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/responses/well-known-feeds/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;.well-known&lt;/code&gt; for RSS feeds on my site&lt;/a&gt;, I had another idea. Since that uses OPML anyways, I remembered recently &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/notes/blogroll-discovery-implemented//"&gt;doing something similar for my blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is the same, except instead of making my blogroll discoverable, I'm doing it for my feeds. At the end of the day, a blogroll is a collection of feeds, so it should just work for my own feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation ended up being:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create an OPML file for&lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/feed"&gt; each of the feeds on by website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-xml"&gt; &amp;lt;opml version=&amp;quot;2.0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Luis Quintanilla Feeds&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;ownerId&amp;gt;https://www.luisquintanilla.me&amp;lt;/ownerId&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;outline title=&amp;quot;Blog&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;Blog&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;rss&amp;quot; htmlUrl=&amp;quot;/posts/1&amp;quot; xmlUrl=&amp;quot;/blog.rss&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;outline title=&amp;quot;Microblog&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;Microblog&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;rss&amp;quot; htmlUrl=&amp;quot;/feed&amp;quot; xmlUrl=&amp;quot;/microblog.rss&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;outline title=&amp;quot;Responses&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;Responses&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;rss&amp;quot; htmlUrl=&amp;quot;/feed/responses&amp;quot; xmlUrl=&amp;quot;/responses.rss&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;outline title=&amp;quot;Mastodon&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;Mastodon&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;rss&amp;quot; htmlUrl=&amp;quot;/mastodon&amp;quot; xmlUrl=&amp;quot;/mastodon.rss&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;outline title=&amp;quot;Bluesky&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;Bluesky&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;rss&amp;quot; htmlUrl=&amp;quot;/bluesky&amp;quot; xmlUrl=&amp;quot;/bluesky.rss&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;outline title=&amp;quot;YouTube&amp;quot; text=&amp;quot;YouTube&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;rss&amp;quot; htmlUrl=&amp;quot;/youtube&amp;quot; xmlUrl=&amp;quot;/bluesky.rss&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/opml&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; tag to the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element of my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-html"&gt; &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;feeds&amp;quot; type=&amp;quot;text/xml&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Luis Quintanilla's Feeds&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;/feed/index.opml&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;p&gt;This is a clever use of &lt;em&gt;.well-known&lt;/em&gt; and OPML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely something I want to experiment with and implement on my site even if it's not widely adopted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zombie Internet</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the supermajority of engagement on viral AI Facebook pages is just as artificially-generated as the content they publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's a child transforming into a water bottle cyborg, a three-armed flight attendant rescuing Tiger Jesus from a muddy plane crash, or a hybrid human-monkey baby being stung to death by giant hornets, all tend to have copy+pasted captions, reactions &amp;amp; comments which usually make no sense in the observed context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've noticed similar patterns on YouTube. Sometime the comments include timestamp links which makes them seem more credible, but upon further inspection, it's all bot activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>21 Years of WordPress</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21 years since Mike and I did the first release of WordPress, forking Michel’s work on b2/cafélog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about elements that made WordPress successful in its early years that we should keep in mind as we build this year and beyond. Here’s 11 opinions:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple things should be easy and intuitive, and complex things possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikis are amazing, and our documentation should be wiki-easy to edit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s important that we all do support, go to meetups and events, anything we can to stay close to regular end-users of what we make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats to WordPress and the team on 21 years. I think the following are some good elements to keep building on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm already subscribed to many of these websites and publications. However, there's several new ones I found that I think will eventually make their rotation into my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/collections/blogroll/"&gt;blogroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing the 100 Sways Project</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Introducing the 100 Sways project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, I plan on creating artifacts like blog posts, newsletters, and websites using &lt;a href="https://sway.cloud.microsoft/"&gt;Microsoft Sway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookmark the site &lt;a href="http://100sways.lqdev.tech"&gt;100sways.lqdev.tech&lt;/a&gt; and follow along!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: If you can't access the website, you can use the &lt;a href="https://sway.cloud.microsoft/aC19McbR3xcNo6s8"&gt;direct link (https://sway.cloud.microsoft/aC19McbR3xcNo6s8)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the 100 Sways project?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is an attempt to show how you might use Sway as a publishing platform for content like newsletters, blog posts, and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was inspired by &lt;a href="https://jamesg.blog/"&gt;James'&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/"&gt;100 things you can do on your personal website post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn more about Microsoft Sway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how you can make the most use out of apps and services already included with your Microsoft Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how easy it is to create and consume web content using Sway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>New Forums Page</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Following the patterns of a blogroll and podroll, I decided to post a &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/collections/forums/"&gt;forums page&lt;/a&gt; to list various forums and communities I find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also created an &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/collections/forums//index.opml"&gt;OPML file&lt;/a&gt; for it so you can subscribe to them in your RSS reader of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discord is good for communities. For example on servers like Shudder there's watch parties and HuggingFace reading club gets together to discuss some of the latest papers. For events, this works really well because everyone can participate in real-time. However, I find that outside of events or general chat, it's difficult to follow the message stream. I like the forum format with topics / threads much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any forum recommendations, feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/contact"&gt;send them my way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Online Local Chronicle</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that every little place in America used to have a printed newspaper, every little place in America could have an online local chronicle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Broadly speaking, an online local chronicle is a collection of facts organized mostly in chronological order. The “pages” of the chronicle can be thought of as subsets of a community’s universal timeline of events. These online local chronicles could become the backbone of local news operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice project. Unfortunately, it's rare you get local news. I like publications / websites like &lt;a href="https://www.hobokengirl.com/"&gt;Hoboken Girl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/"&gt;Block Club Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. I wish there were more of them in more cities and towns. I know they're there in some forms like Facebook Groups. Even better, it'd be great to have the websites for these publications be the main source of truth that then syndicated their content to the various platforms out there.&lt;/p&gt;
