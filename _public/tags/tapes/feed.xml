      <title>The cassette tape is making a comeback</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the odds, cassette tapes are making a comeback. And one family-owned company in Springfield, Missouri is a leader in the revival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this also means that players are also making a comeback because you need something to play them on. Having visited a museum recently full of old radio recordings on cassette tapes, I was sad to find out I couldn't listen to them because the tape player was broken. It's hard enough finding a decent MP3 player, I'm sure it must be just as hard if not harder finding a tape player.&lt;/p&gt;
