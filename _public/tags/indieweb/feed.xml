      <title>Copilot, add new features. But first, coffee</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Something I've tried to make a habit of on a weekly basis is compiling a post which aggregates all posts on my website from the past week. Because right now it's not fully automated and I haven't been posting as much, there are gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is fairly straightforward. I run a script that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collects all of the previous week's posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drafts a note with links to all the posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I publish the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this is mostly automated, I decided it was something I could just create a GitHub Action to do the post generation and publishing on my behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there were some issues with the original file generation and formatting that were annoying, but easy enough to fix manually so I never invested time in fixing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I created a few issues describing the features and improvements I wanted to make. Worth noting, I did this from my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/issues/213"&gt;#213&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/issues/215"&gt;#215&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than working on them though, I assigned them to GitHub Coding Agent and stepped out to grab coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent worked on solutions in the background and by the time I got back, I had working solutions. They weren't perfect but with no input from me, it got 90-95% of it right. The rest were minor refinements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing my GH mobile publishing flow</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;h2&gt;This is a post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as posts go it's &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can write &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-fsharp"&gt;let x = 1
x * x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be or not to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day we will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add bookmarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add media posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some attachments?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Which Static Site Generator (SSG) do I use?</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reply] &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://xoxo.zone/@artlung/"&gt;@artlung@xoxo.zone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started, I used Hexo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I moved to Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, I decided to roll my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently my site's content and the generator live in the same &lt;a href="https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me"&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not up to date, my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/colophon"&gt;colophon&lt;/a&gt; contains details of how my site is built. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/blob/main/README.md"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; in the repo also contains more up to date information since the massive revamp I made last month (which I still need to write about). I think that revamp and decoupling of various components in my site would've been significantly harder had I not been in complete control of my codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have to pay a maintenance toll by owning the code that generates my site, knowing the entire codebase also gives me freedom to experiment and explore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notes on why blogging lost to Twitter</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;p&gt;I haven't listened to the &lt;a href="https://shownotes.scripting.com/scripting/2025/09/08/whyBloggingLostToTwitterAndOtherFolkSongs.html"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; yet but there's a lot of good points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribing in feed readers required too many steps: copying URLs, menus, pasting, confirming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging lost to Twitter because Twitter had one-click subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebooting the blogosphere requires cooperation and a universal &amp;quot;follow&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can go back to vinyl records and film cameras, we can go back to blogs and RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we need permission from the masses before we do something that might bring us joy?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Internet's Hidden Creative Renaissance</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;p&gt;Great post from &lt;a href="https://blogtherapy.substack.com/about"&gt;Alexandra&lt;/a&gt;. Tons of great resources to explore as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...recently the indie web has been experiencing a revival, as more netizens look for connection outside the walled gardens created by tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kinds of posts and projects you’ll find are creative, personal, experimental, and sometimes so intimate you feel like you’re intruding. However, they’re not the kind of content that usually goes viral on TikTok. That’s beside the point. The focus isn’t on personal branding, growth or monetization, or “content” creation, but on freedom from those things. Instead of polished, 10-second snippets optimized for mass-appeal, engagement, and profit, these are largely slow-cooked projects made just for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against a backdrop of accelerating enshittification and living chronically online — especially since the COVID pandemic — there’s growing interest in the slower, more intentional and connected experience the indie web promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In different corners of the mainstream internet, younger users are talking about reclaiming their attention spans, trading in their smartphones, writing essays for fun, journaling, discovering long reads, reading fiction, and picking up hobbies like crocheting or scrapbooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discoverability can be a challenge...But what seems like a bug can really be a feature of the small web experience: the point is to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the greater context of the global internet, the small web will never completely replace big platforms or serve every need, nor should it. Social media is still the main source of news in many parts of the world, offering valuable tools for community-building, commerce, even activism. For their part, most indie web creators are happy to exist outside of the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Reflections on the social web</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of a product team, when working with new technology, is to abstract away as much of this complexity as possible, so that it feels friendly and approachable to new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My strongest belief about the social web is that if we want it to succeed, we have to keep lowering the barrier to entry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile-First Static Site Publishing: Discord Bot Pipeline via Azure and GitHub</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## The problem

Ever since I published my [first note](/notes/hello-world)([microblog post](https://indieweb.org/note)) on my website, I've always wanted a way to quickly publish while on the go. Unfortunately, I never found a good solution. 

Because my website is statically generated and the source is hosted on GitHub(check out the [colophon](/colophon) for more details), there is no backend for me to talk to. At the same time, I didn't want to build an entire backend to support my website because I want to keep things as lean and cost-efficient as possible. 

Since my posts are just frontmatter and Markdown, I [use VS Code as my editor](/uses). For some time, back when I used to have a Surface Duo, I [authored posts from mobile using the github.dev experience](https://www.lqdev.me/notes/surface-duo-blogging-github-dev). On two screens, while not ideal, it was manageable. After switching devices (because sadly there were no more security updates on the Surface Duo) and upgrading to a dumbphone and later a single screen smartphone, that workflow wasn't feasible.

At that point, what I resorted to was sending messages to myself via [Element](https://element.io/). The message would contain a link I wanted to check out later. Once I was on my laptop, I would check out the link and if I wanted to post about it on my website, I'd do so then. 

That process, while it worked, wasn't necessarily scalable. In part that's a feature because I could spend more time digesting the content and writing a thoughtful article. However, it stopped me from sharing more in the moment and there were posts that were never authored or bookmarks that weren't captured because eventually that link got lost in the river of other links. 

Basically what I wanted to replicate was the more instant posting that social media gives you, but do so on my own site. 

That led me to doing some thinking and requirement gathering around the type of experience I wanted to have.

## Requirements

When it came to requirements for my solution, I was focused more on the workflow and experience rather on technical details. 

Here is a list of those solution requirements:

- Mobile is the primary publishing interface. Desktop publishing is a nice to have.
- Be as low-friction as sharing a link via Element or posting on social media
- Doesn't require implementing my own client or frontend
- Doesn't require me to use existing micropub clients
- Handles short-form and media posts supported by my website
    - Notes
    - Responses
        - Repost
        - Reply
        - Like
    - Bookmark
    - Media
        - Image
        - Audio (not used as often but technically supported)
        - Video (not used as often but technically supported)
- Low-cost

## The solution

For years, I had been struggling with actually implementing this system. The main part that gave me pause was not implementing my own client or relying on existing micropub clients. 

Eventually, I just accepted that it might never happen. 

One day, it eventually hit me. If the notes to self Element workflow worked so well, why not use a chat client as the frontend for publishing. At least have it serve as the capture system that would then format the content into a post that gets queued for publishing on GitHub. I'd seen [Benji do something similar with his micropub endpoint](https://github.com/benjifs/serverless-micropub). 

While I could've used Element since that's my preferred platform, I've been contemplating no longer hosting my own Matrix server. So if I went through with this, I'd want something that I didn't feel bad about investing the time on this solution if that chat client went away. 

That then left me with Discord as the next best option. Primarily because of its support for bots as well as its cross-platform support across mobile and desktop. 

In the end, the solution then ended up being fairly straightforward. 

More importantly, with the help of AI, I wrote none of the code. 

Using Copilot and Claude Sonnet 4, I was able to go from idea to deployment in 1-2 days. At that time the solution supported all of the posts except for media which I hadn't figured out what the best way of uploading media through Discord was. Figuring that out, implementing it, and deploying it took another day or two. 

Since I wanted for my solution to be as low-cost as possible, serverless seemed like a good option. I only pay for compute when it's actually being used which can be infrequent in my case. I don't need the server running 24/7 or even to be powerful. However, I didn't want to write my system as an Azure Function. I wanted the flexibility of deploying on a shared VM or container. A VM though wasn't an option since it's running 24/7. Keeping all of that in mind, my choice was narrowed down to Azure Container Apps which gave me the characteristics I was looking for. Serverless containers. 

Once that decision was made, I used Copilot again to figure out how to optimize my container image so that it's space and resource efficient. And while at it, I used Copilot again to figure out the right incantations to get the container deployed to Azure Container Apps. 

All-in-all, the solution had been staring at me in the face since I already had a workflow that for the most part worked for me, it just needed some optimizations and with the help of AI, I was able to quickly build and deploy something I'd been ruminating over for years.  

## Workflow

The workflow for publishing is as follows:

1. Invoke the bot in Discord to capture my input using slash command `/post` and the respective post type.

    ![Using slash commands to invoke discord publishing bot](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/invoke-discord-publishing-bot.png)

1. Provide post details. For media posts, I can provide an attachment which gets uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.

    ![A modal in discord with note post fields filled in](http://cdn.lqdev.tech/files/images/discord-publishing-client-modal.png)

1. [Bot creates a branch and PR in my repo](https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/pull/152) with the post content
1. While logged into GitHub from my phone, if everything looks good, I merge the PR which kicks off my GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish the site including the new post. 
1. Post [displays on my website](/media/test-media-post-from-mobile/).

## Challenges

The solution is not perfect. 

One of the problems I've run into is cold-start. Since I scale my solution down to zero when it's not being used to save on costs, I suffer from the cold start problem. Therefore, when I first invoke the bot, it fails. I have to give it a few seconds and retry the invocation. It's usually about 5 seconds so it's not a huge issue but it does add some friction. 

## Next steps

Overall I'm happy with my solution but there are a few improvements I'd like to make.

- **Open-source the repo** - Currently I've kept the repo private since it was all AI generated. Since my system is already in production and processes were documented, I need to do a more thorough pass to make sure that no secrets or credentials are checked in or documented anywhere.
- **Improve UX** - Discord limits modal fields to 5. Therefore, I'm playing around with the right balance between how much of the input should come from slash commands and how much should come from the modal.
- **Expand supported post types** - I'd like to expand the number of posts supported by my publishing client. Reviews are a good example of the type of post I'd like to support as well as RSVPs. [Reviews I already support](https://www.lqdev.me/reviews) on my website but RSVPs I don't yet. Also, I'd have to fix my Webmentions which are currently broken after [upgrading my website](/notes/hello-world-new-site-2025-08/). 
- **Make it generator agnostic** - Currently this only works for my website. With a few tweaks and refactoring, I think I can get the project to a place where it should work with other popular static site generators. 
- **One-click deployment** - Currently the solution is packaged up as a container so it can be deployed from anywhere. I want to make it even simpler to deploy. One click if possible.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Just iterated on another version of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major change is that there's now a text-first version of the website for minimal and resource-constrained environments over at &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/text"&gt;/text&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also added search functionality, which you can find at &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/search"&gt;/search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;url.town doesn’t have any overly lofty ambitions; we’re just building our own directory of really nice websites. We’re not trying to fully recreate the original Yahoo! or DMOZ directories. We’re not aiming for some astronomical number of links. This is just one space on the web, tied to a community that loves to share neat things with one another. Quality matters much more than quantity. There’s no need to share everything just for the shake of sharing it; it’s much better to share things that are useful or interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello world from the new site</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Posting from my brand new redesigned website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working on it for about a month so I plan on doing a longer writeup on what has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a few things that are broken, but for the most part, I'm happy with the progress and the changes that need to be made are incremental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a ton of cleanup as well but again. That is not a blocker to publishing the site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IndieWeb Create Day - July 2025</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
Since it was a holiday weekend in the U.S. that kind of snuck up on me, I found myself with nothing planned on a Saturday. So I chose to spend it creating stuff for my website with the IndieWeb community during [IndieWeb Create Day](https://events.indieweb.org/2025/07/indieweb-create-day-3q2PTCbGioi9).

Over the last few months I've been overthinking my website redesign and while I've made several attempts at it, I've never been satisfied the outcome. I end up throwing away all the progress I've made and go back to the drawing board. 

Yesterday, I decided to not let perfect be the enemy of good and the approach I took was creating just a simpler piece of functionality outside of my website. How I integrate it into my website is a future me problem. But I want to work from a place of creativity and complete freedom to think of what could be rather than what is. 

With that in mind, I set out to sketch out how I want to create and render media (image, audio, video) posts. The approach I took used a combination of front-matter YAML and custom markdown media extensions. The front-matter YAML is something that I already use for my website and it's something that I want to continue using. However, in contrast to my current website, I like that the front-matter was kept simple and only includes a basic amount of information. The actual post content was handled by my custom markdown extension which leveraged YAML-like syntax to define media content. What's great about this is that it is composable so once I got one type of media working, the rest for the most part "just worked". I could even mix different media types within the same post with no additional work or code changes required. Once I had the skeleton, it was all about refactoring, documentation, adding finishing touches, and vibe-coding some CSS which Claude did a relatively good job with given the aesthetic I was going for. 

Overall, I'm happy with the end result.

For more details, you can check out the [repo](https://github.com/lqdev/indieweb-create-day-2025-07).

At some point, I want to be able to integrate these media posts into my static site generator but for the time being, there are other kinds of posts such as reviews, RSVPs, and other [post types](https://indieweb.org/posts#Types_of_Posts) that I want to design and eventually also support on my website. I liked the approach I took this time around because it gave me the freedom to explore posibilities rather than constrain my creativity to what I've already built. So I think I'll keep doing the same for subsequent post types. 

At the end of the day, it was nice seeing everyone else's projects. My favorite one was Cy's recipe website. I want to be like them when I grow up 🙂.]]&gt;</description>
