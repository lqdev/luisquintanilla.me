      <title>Mindcage</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I didn't know Martin Lawrence was still making movies. I knew about Bad Boys but that was almost 4 years ago. Just watched &lt;a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mindcage"&gt;Mindcage&lt;/a&gt;, one of his latest ones. It was alright. The story is similar to Silence of the Lambs. Detectives seeking help from a manipulative serial killer to catch another killer on the loose. The twist at the end was interesting and not what I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;
