      <title>Short Long Form</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[[reshare] &lt;p&gt;This is something I've been dealing with on my site. I separate my &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/posts/1"&gt;long-form&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/feed"&gt;short-form&lt;/a&gt; posts. However, I don't have a hard limit that clearly defines which is which. An initial reason for the separation was, I wanted to have a feed that was easy to scroll through. That was harder to do if I was rendering an entire long-form post as part of the feed. In the end though, most of my posts are all markdown files and their main distinction is how they are rendered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I work on my website redesign, I want to change how I think about posts. I want to separate the post content from the rendering. A post is a post regardless of content and length. Regardless of whether it's a response, image, video, note, or anything in between, I don't want to constrain the content of my post. I can choose to render posts differently depending on whether it's being viewed in a feed or individual post page. The content driving those different views though shouldn't change.&lt;/p&gt;
