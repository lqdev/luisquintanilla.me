      <title>College Football Week 1 Notes</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;College football is back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn State had a great win. Looking back at a &lt;a href="https://www.lqdev.me/notes/psu-future-allar"&gt;post from last year&lt;/a&gt;, some of my thoughts around the upcoming class were right. Looking at the upcoming schedule it looks well spaced out and if they can stay healthy, they'll have a great season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tough losses for LSU and Clemson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I'm trying a new way to experience games: blogs + audio streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week, although I tuned into the games, I didn't watch any of them on TV. Instead, I tuned into the live audio streams on &lt;a href="https://thevarsitynetwork.com/feed"&gt;The Varsity Network&lt;/a&gt; and for live discusson, I tuned into the various team blogs / communities provided by &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/"&gt;SBNation&lt;/a&gt; (fun fact: I learned SB stands for Sports Blogs). For example, &lt;a href="https://www.blackshoediaries.com/"&gt;Black Shoe Diaries&lt;/a&gt;, the Penn State blog, had a &lt;a href="https://www.blackshoediaries.com/2023/9/2/23855867/penn-state-nittany-lions-football-west-virginia-fourth-quarter-open-thread-bsd"&gt;live thread&lt;/a&gt; for each of the quarters where site writers and fans got to interact in real-time. Other team blogs had similar threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I thought it was a fun experience, and I'm most likely going to do it again this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games I'm most looking forward to Week 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanford vs USC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temple vs Rutgers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas vs Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
