With the release of Angular and React, I tried both of them and while both are great tools the learning took significantly longer because I also had to learn the bundler systems and in the case of Angular, TypeScript. Although the CLI tools go a long way towards automating a lot of the setup process, building an application from scratch in these frameworks is not intuitive especially for a newcomer. In the early days of Vue, I was able to attend a Meetup presentation by <a href="https://twitter.com/youyuxi">Evan You</a> which went over the philosophy of Vue as well as its capabilities. I was instantly interested because of how easy it was to get started. Since that presentation, I have not had time to try it but with AngularJS being phased out, I felt it was about time to start exploring another framework. To get a better understanding of the framework's features prior to using CLI tools, I created a standalone application that relies only on NPM packages. In this writeup, I will create a Hacker News client with Vue that calls the Hacker News API and displays the top 50 stories.

With inspiration from <a href="https://twitter.com/csharpfritz">Jeff Fritz</a>, I have been learning F# for the past week and a half or so. When trying to think of projects to start practicing my F#, porting over the code I had built in C# naturally came to mind. After overcoming many obstacles and with much guidance from <a href="https://github.com/voronoipotato">Alan Ball</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham">Isaac Abraham</a> whose F# <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Get-Programming-guide-NET-developers/dp/1617293997/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1528929802&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=get+programming+with+F%23">book</a> I highly recommend, I was able to successfully port over the main parts of my code which highlight <code>ML.NET</code> functionality. In this writeup, I will port a C# <code>ML.NET</code> classification model to F# which predicts the type of flower based on four numerical measurement inputs. I tried to keep the organization of this post nearly identical to that of the C# article where possible. Sample code for this project can be found at the following <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/fsmlnetdemo">link</a>.</p>

I have looked at F# in the past, but often times have not done much with it. After the stream, I decided to keep plugging away at it and one of the first things I thought about doing was organizing my code into separate files. As simple as it may seem, it was no easy task and while there are many different ways of doing it, the method described in this writeup is one of the easiest I found. Keep in mind though that this may not be the appropriate way of doing it although it seems to work nicely for our purposes. In this solution I will create a set of mathematical operations that will be organized into a single module that will then be imported and used inside of my console application. Source code for this sample solution can be found at this <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/fsharpmoduledemo">link</a>.</p>

The focus this year was on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Some of the products I found particularly interesting are <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/">Azure Container Instances</a> which makes it easier to run containerized applications without provisioning or managing servers and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet">ML.NET</a> which is a .NET cross-platform machine learning framework. In this writeup, I will make use of both these products by creating a machine learning classification model with <code>ML.NET</code>, exposing it via an ASP.NET Core Web API, packaging it into a Docker container and deploying it to the cloud via Azure Container Instances. Source code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/mlnetacidemo">here</a>.</p>

I have built single container applications using a <code>Dockerfile</code> and run them locally. This works fine, especially for deployment purposes to a production VM but it's no different than setting up the VM with all the required dependencies and pushing updates via FTP or source control. However, one of the features that I have found extremely useful is multi-container building and deployment via <code>docker-compose</code>. With <code>docker-compose</code>, not only can I build and run my application, but also dependent services like databases, caches, proxies, etc. Best of all, the builds are standardized and initialized at once without having to individually install the dependencies and components. This writeup explores how to containerize a MEAN stack application and set up a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file for it to build and start the server and database services defined within it.</p>
