I have several Windows 10 devices, but needed a Linux system while on the go. I had given my HP Chromebook a try using Crouton. This worked okay. However, I was limited by the specs of the Chromebook and wanted something with more power for development purposes. Therefore, I erased Windows 10 on the ProBook and installed Ubuntu. The PC worked well. My only problem with it was that I found my battery meter was inaccurate and would reach a percentage in the 60â€™s before suddenly dropping to zero and shutting down. This was not something I could have, especially during the middle of a work session where I might lose some/all of my work</p>

However, in order to get access to it and all its features, there is a fee associated with it. Depending on the needs of the user, this price can at times be somewhat large. Luckily, an open source alternative known as Octave exists which works just as good in many cases at zero monetary cost. Octave's syntax is for the most part identical to MatLab making the transition a relatively simple one.</p>

This will be a blog post for documenting my learning process as well as sharing projects and ideas I come across. I often find myself doing things, researching how to do them and completing a task. A few weeks/months later I might have to do something similar and have to go through the process again. Using this blog will help me keep me reference that knowledge</p>
