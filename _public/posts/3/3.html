Another tool that can be leveraged to create resources in Azure is <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>. Terraform via configuration files can build and manage infrastructure across various providers such as AWS, Azure and Google. One of the benefits of Terraform is that it allows infastructure and resources to be defined as code. The configuration files serve as a blueprint as well as an execution plan of what needs to be provisioned in the cloud. Not only does this allow for automation and removal of human error in configurations but it also serves as a way to document the different changes infrastructure has gone through thoroughout the application lifecycle. The purpose of this writeup is to show how to create an environment using Terraform for an application that utilizes Azure Cognitive Services. Our application will create a Computer Vision service that we can then use via HTTP requests.

One if its noteworthy services, Azure Pipelines, helps developers build Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines that automate and standardize the build, test and deploy phases of the software development process. In addition, Azure Pipelines provides native container support and works with any language, platform and cloud. Machine learning like software development is also a process that includes a build, test and deploy phase which makes it a good candidate for automation and standardization. At Build 2018, Microsoft announced <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning">ML.NET</a>, an open-source, cross-plaform machine learning framework for .NET. If we were to put all of these tools and services together, it means that we can automate and standardize the training of a machine learning model built with ML.NET, package it into a Docker container and deploy it to Azure Container Instances (ACI). In this writeup, I will go through the process of building a CI/CD pipeline in Azure Devops that trains, packages and deploys an ML.NET machine learning model to predict which class an Iris flower belongs to using a variety of measurements. Source code for this project can be found at this <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/mlnetazdevopssample">link</a>.</p>

While this is certainly a good way to deploy such models especially those that are critical and require high availability and/or consist of long-running processes, it's not the case when those requirements are not needed. In such cases serverless computing makes more sense from a cost and resource utilization standpoint. Therefore, in this blog post I will go over how to train a classification model with <code>ML.NET</code> and deploy it using Azure Functions.
