The most common way to do so is by exposing models as a web service through APIs or serverless functions. One of the considerations when deploying a model as a web service is latency and performance. The process of making predictions over HTTP using a model involves accepting the user input, loading the serialized version of the model from a file, using the model to make a prediction, and returning the prediction back to the user. Since models are typically just static files, another way of deploying a model is as a static asset over the web, just like any other HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file. This deployment method is similar to that of TensorFlow.js. Deploying in this way has several advantages. One advantage is that there is no longer a web service just to serve the model, making it more cost-efficient. Another advantage is that once the model has been downloaded onto the user's PC, the resources used at that point are those of the user's PC rather than the server the model would otherwise be hosted in. Finally, because the model is a static file, it can be distributed via CDNs.</p>

As a result some changes took effect. Most notably, in version 1.0, a template for an F# HttpTrigger function was available. The template was removed in 2.0. However, that does not mean Azure Functions does not support F#. Azure Functions can be built in F# using a .NET Standard Class Library. This writeup provides a detailed walk-through of how to build an Azure Function that processes HTTP requests using F#. The complete code sample can be found on <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/FsHttpTriggerSample">GitHub</a>.</p>

For years, it has been a staple in the Big Data ecosystem for batch and real-time processing on large datasets. Although native support for the platform is limited to the JVM set of languages, other languages typically used for data processing and analytics like Python and R have plugged into Spark's Interop layer to make use of its functionality. Around the Build 2019 conference, Microsoft announced Spark.NET. Spark.NET provides bindings written for the Spark Interop layer that allow you to work with components like Spark SQL and Spark Streaming inside your .NET applications. Because Spark.NET is .NET Standard 2.0 compliant, it can run operating systems like Windows, Mac and Linux. Spark.NET is an evolution of the Mobius project which provided .NET bindings for Spark.</p>
