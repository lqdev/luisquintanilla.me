When programming in the terminal, I usually used vim. When compared to Emacs, the learning curve was relatively flat and it handled file editing just fine. Iâ€™ve read many articles that rave about Emacs and how powerful it can be. Therefore, a couple of months ago I took the plunge and decided to give it a try. Using dired mode to browse through the various directories in my system or project was a neat feature but for my purposes of basic file editing it did not offer anything that would warrant a switch. Furthermore, the default key bindings seemed a bit too much for me which caused me to  revert back to vim</p>
