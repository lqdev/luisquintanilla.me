I've seen many people including Elon Musk recommend Signal. Signal is a great alternative but there are a few others that are worth considering. This recommendation was originally planned as a tweet, but there's so many details that just can't be captured in a tweet or thread so instead I turned it into a blog post. If you haven't made the switch or if you're still not completely committed to the platform you've switched to, this post is for you.</p>

Originally, streams were centered around gaming but now there is a wide variety of creators that include musicians, software developers, and craftspeople. One of my favorites is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/brainfeeder">Brainfeeder</a>. I myself try (and often fail) to build software projects on stream.

Although you can build traditional web applications with it, it would be nice to use it with cloud-native technologies like serverless. Azure Functions is designed for these types of event-driven workflows but unfortunately does not officially support Racket. Recently, a new feature called custom handlers was announced which allows individuals to run web applications written in any language that supports HTTP primitives as an Azure Function. When I learned of this feature, my immediate thought was, challenge accepted!</p>
