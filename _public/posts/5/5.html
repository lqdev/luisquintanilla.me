The syntax is readable and allows pseudocode to be converted into code nearly verbatim. While this is great for prototyping and moving fast, scaling can become an issue. One of the issues is with regards to documentation. In statically typed languages, even if there's no documentation, types help provide some sort of documentation that allow new contributors as well current developers to remember where they left off and what their code does. There are ways around this using docstrings as well as unit tests. However, this often involves performing tasks outside of writing code which can be time consuming. In Python 3.5, type hints or optional static typing are allowed and tools like <code>mypy</code> help write safer, more scalable code. The best part is, if the code already has docstrings and unit tests, optional static typing adds an additional layer of safety and documentation to existing projects. This writeup explores practices for documenting and developing scalable Python code as well as illustrating how to use optional static types and type checkers.</p>

At the time, I saw a demo and it looked like an interesting tool but I knew very little about it. This past week, while practicing <code>css</code> and scaffolding a blog-like web page for practice I decided to give Emmet a try. After reading some of the documentation and trying it out, within five minutes I was able to replicate what I had done manually with one line of &quot;code&quot;. The entire process is described below.</p>

Furthermore, being able to deploy your code/packages to a central repository with a package manager makes distribution easier. Although this can all be done manually, it can also be automated. Both testing and deployment can be automated using Travis CI which makes the entire process as easy as pushing your most recent changes to GitHub. In this writeup, I will go over how to create a Python project with unit tests and deploy to PyPI. A sample project can be found at this <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/TravisTest">link</a></p>
<h2>Prerequisi</h2>
</li><li class="list-group-item"><a href="/posts/transcribing-podcasts-microsoft-speech-api.html"><h3>Transcribing Podcasts with Microsoft Speech API</h3></a><p>I enjoy listening to podcasts in a wide range of topics that include but are not limited to politics, software development, history, comedy and true crime. While some of the more entertainment related podcasts are best enjoyed through audio, those that are related to software development or other type of hands-on topics would benefit greatly from having a transcript. Having a transcript allows me to go back after having listened to an interesting discussion and look directly at the content I am interested in without having to listen to the podcast again. This however is not always feasible given that it costs both time and money to produce a transcript. Fortunately, there are tools out there such as Google Cloud Speech and Microsoft Speech API which allow users to convert speech to text. For this writeup, I will be focusing on the Microsoft Speech API. Because podcasts tend to be long-form, I will be using the C# client library because it allows for long audio (greater than 15 seconds) to be transcribed. The purpose of this exercise is to create a console application that takes audio segments, converts them to text and stores the results in a text file with the goal of evaluating how well the Microsoft Speech API works. The source code for the console application can be found on <a href="https://github.com/lqdev/PodcastsBingSpeechAPIDemo">GitHub</a></p>
