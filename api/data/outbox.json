How, she asks, can we learn from Indigenous wisdom and the plant world to reimagine what we value most? Our economy is rooted in scarcity, competition, and the hoarding of resources, and we have surrendered our values to a system that actively harms what we love. Meanwhile, the serviceberryâ\u0080\u0099s relationship with the natural world is an embodiment of reciprocity, interconnectedness, and gratitude. The tree distributes its wealthâ\u0080\u0094its abundance of sweet, juicy berriesâ\u0080\u0094to meet the needs of its natural community. And this distribution ensures its own survival. As Kimmerer explains, â\u0080\u009CServiceberries show us another model, one based upon reciprocity, where wealth comes from the quality of your relationships, not from the illusion of self-sufficiency.â\u0080\u009D<br />\n<br>\nAs Elizabeth Gilbert writes, Robin Wall Kimmerer is â\u0080\u009Ca great teacher, and her words are a hymn of love to the world.â\u0080\u009D The Serviceberry is an antidote to the broken relationships and misguided goals of our times, and a reminder that â\u0080\u009Choarding wonâ\u0080\u0099t save us, all flourishing is mutual.â\u0080\u009D<br />\n<br>\nRobin Wall Kimmerer is donating her advance payments from this book as a reciprocal gift, back to the land, for land protection, restoration, and justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Review</h2>\n<p>I'm happy my name is not Darren.</p>\n<p>What started as an <a href=\"https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/the-serviceberry/\">essay</a> expanded into book form. I like how Robin uses her experience working with plants and nature and draws parallels to our society and way of life. We are not separate from nature and it has a lot of lessons we could learn from.</p>\n]]>",

As the article mentions, part of that is ownership and actually owning the things I pay for. More importantly though, rather than scrolling through an endless catalog and never finding something to watch or read, I have a curated set of items to enjoy in a more mindful manner. If I feel the need to scroll through an endless catalog, there's always the library which has tons of media available. I find the library to be a heavily underutilized and almost forgotten community service we've all already paid for in some way, so why not use it.</p>\n]]>",

Early platforms sold themselves as conduits for genuine connection: stuff you wanted to see, like your friendâ\u0080\u0099s wedding and your cousinâ\u0080\u0099s dog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The feed no longer feels crowded with people but crowded with content. At this point, it has far less to do with people than with consumers and consumption.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Whatever remains of genuine, human content is increasingly sidelined by algorithmic prioritization, receiving fewer interactions than the engineered content and AI slop optimized solely for clicks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>While content proliferates, engagement is evaporating...People arenâ\u0080\u0099t connecting or conversing on social media like they used to; theyâ\u0080\u0099re just wading through slop, that is, low-effort, low-quality content produced at scale, often with AI, for engagement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Engagement is now about raw user attention â\u0080\u0093 time spent, impressions, scroll velocity â\u0080\u0093 and the net effect is an online world in which you are constantly being addressed but never truly spoken to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Social mediaâ\u0080\u0099s death rattle will not be a bang but a shrug.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>These networks once promised a single interface for the whole of online life...But now, the model is splintering, and users are drifting toward smaller, slower, more private spaces, like group chats, Discord servers and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol\">federated microblogs</a> â\u0080\u0094 a billion little gardens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Intentional, opt-in microâ\u0080\u0091communities are rising in their place â\u0080\u0094 like Patreon collectives and Substack newsletters â\u0080\u0094 where creators chase depth over scale, retention over virality. A writer with 10,000 devoted subscribers can potentially earn more and burn out less than one with a million passive followers on Instagram.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>These are the last days of social media, not because we lack content, but because the attention economy has neared its outer limit â\u0080\u0094 we have exhausted the capacity to care.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Our offline reality is irrevocably shaped by our online world. Consider the worker who deletes or was never on LinkedIn, excluding themselves from professional networks that increasingly exist nowhere else</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>These platforms havenâ\u0080\u0099t just captured attention, theyâ\u0080\u0099ve enclosed the commons where social, economic and cultural capital are exchanged. But enclosure breeds resistance, and as exhaustion sets in, alternatives begin to emerge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>...as social media collapses on itself, the future points to a quieter, more fractured, more human web, something that no longer promises to be everything, everywhere, for everyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>We can dream of a digital future where belonging is no longer measured by follower counts or engagement rates, but rather by the development of trust and the quality of conversation...None of this is about escaping the social internet, but about reclaiming its scale, pace, and purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The technical architecture of the next social web is already emerging through federated and distributed protocols like ActivityPub...But protocols alone wonâ\u0080\u0099t save us. The email protocol is decentralized, yet most email flows through a handful of corporate providers. We need to â\u0080\u009Crewild the internet,â\u0080\u009D as Maria Farrell and Robin Berjon mentioned in a Noema essay.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Social media as we know it is dying, but weâ\u0080\u0099re not condemned to its ruins. We are capable of building better â\u0080\u0094 smaller, slower, more intentional, more accountable â\u0080\u0094 spaces for digital interaction, spaces where the metrics that matter arenâ\u0080\u0099t engagement and growth but understanding and connection, where algorithms serve the community rather than strip-mining it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>The last days of social media might be the first days of something more human: a web that remembers why we came online in the first place â\u0080\u0094 not to be harvested but to be heard, not to go viral but to find our people, not to scroll but to connect. We built these systems, and we can certainly build better ones. The question is whether we will do this or whether we will continue to drown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n]]>",

However, theyâ\u0080\u0099re not the kind of content that usually goes viral on TikTok. Thatâ\u0080\u0099s beside the point. The focus isnâ\u0080\u0099t on personal branding, growth or monetization, or â\u0080\u009Ccontentâ\u0080\u009D creation, but on freedom from those things. Instead of polished, 10-second snippets optimized for mass-appeal, engagement, and profit, these are largely slow-cooked projects made just for fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Against a backdrop of accelerating enshittification and living chronically online â\u0080\u0094 especially since the COVID pandemic â\u0080\u0094 thereâ\u0080\u0099s growing interest in the slower, more intentional and connected experience the indie web promises.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>In different corners of the mainstream internet, younger users are talking about reclaiming their attention spans, trading in their smartphones, writing essays for fun, journaling, discovering long reads, reading fiction, and picking up hobbies like crocheting or scrapbooking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>Discoverability can be a challenge...But what seems like a bug can really be a feature of the small web experience: the point is to explore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n<p>In the greater context of the global internet, the small web will never completely replace big platforms or serve every need, nor should it.
