The <a href=\"https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/blob/main/README.md\">README</a> in the repo also contains more up to date information since the massive revamp I made last month (which I still need to write about). I think that revamp and decoupling of various components in my site would've been significantly harder had I not been in complete control of my codebase.</p>\n<p>Although I have to pay a maintenance toll by owning the code that generates my site, knowing the entire codebase also gives me freedom to experiment and explore.</p>\n]]>",
