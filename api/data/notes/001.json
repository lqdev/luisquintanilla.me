How, she asks, can we learn from Indigenous wisdom and the plant world to reimagine what we value most? Our economy is rooted in scarcity, competition, and the hoarding of resources, and we have surrendered our values to a system that actively harms what we love. Meanwhile, the serviceberryâ\u0080\u0099s relationship with the natural world is an embodiment of reciprocity, interconnectedness, and gratitude. The tree distributes its wealthâ\u0080\u0094its abundance of sweet, juicy berriesâ\u0080\u0094to meet the needs of its natural community. And this distribution ensures its own survival. As Kimmerer explains, â\u0080\u009CServiceberries show us another model, one based upon reciprocity, where wealth comes from the quality of your relationships, not from the illusion of self-sufficiency.â\u0080\u009D<br />\n<br>\nAs Elizabeth Gilbert writes, Robin Wall Kimmerer is â\u0080\u009Ca great teacher, and her words are a hymn of love to the world.â\u0080\u009D The Serviceberry is an antidote to the broken relationships and misguided goals of our times, and a reminder that â\u0080\u009Choarding wonâ\u0080\u0099t save us, all flourishing is mutual.â\u0080\u009D<br />\n<br>\nRobin Wall Kimmerer is donating her advance payments from this book as a reciprocal gift, back to the land, for land protection, restoration, and justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Review</h2>\n<p>I'm happy my name is not Darren.</p>\n<p>What started as an <a href=\"https://emergencemagazine.org/essay/the-serviceberry/\">essay</a> expanded into book form. I like how Robin uses her experience working with plants and nature and draws parallels to our society and way of life. We are not separate from nature and it has a lot of lessons we could learn from.</p>\n]]>",
