# Azure Functions API Setup for Wildcard File Redirects

## Installation

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
cd api
npm install
```

2. Install Azure Functions Core Tools (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true
```

## Local Development

Start the Functions runtime locally:
```bash
cd api
func start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:7071/api/files/{filePath}`

## Testing

Test the redirect functionality:

### Basic file redirect:
```bash
curl -I "http://localhost:7071/api/files/document.pdf"
```

Expected response:
```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://luisquintanillame.blob.core.windows.net/files/document.pdf
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```

### Nested path redirect:
```bash
curl -I "http://localhost:7071/api/files/reports/2024/summary.pdf"
```

Expected response:
```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://luisquintanillame.blob.core.windows.net/files/reports/2024/summary.pdf
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```

### With query parameters:
```bash
curl -I "http://localhost:7071/api/files/document.pdf?download=true"
```

Expected response:
```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://luisquintanillame.blob.core.windows.net/files/document.pdf?download=true
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```

## Security Features

- Path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- Query parameter preservation maintains functionality
- Logging for monitoring and debugging
- Error handling for malformed requests

## Performance Optimizations

- HTTP 301 permanent redirects for SEO benefits
- Cache-Control headers reduce repeat requests
- Minimal execution time for cost efficiency
- X-Robots-Tag prevents search engine indexing of redirect URLs

## Integration with Azure Static Web Apps

The function automatically integrates with Azure Static Web Apps when deployed. Requests to `/files/*` will be handled by the Azure Functions runtime at `/api/files/*`.

URLs that previously would have been:
- `https://yoursite.com/files/document.pdf`

Are now handled through:
- `https://yoursite.com/files/document.pdf` â†’ redirects via Azure Functions

The user experience remains identical while gaining proper wildcard redirect functionality.
