# Website Development Backlog

*Last Updated: 2025-01-13*

This backlog drives the systematic architectural upgrade of the indieweb content management system, transforming from a collection of 20+ repetitive build functions to a unified, generic content processing system with custom block support.

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status: Critical Functionality Fix Required ðŸš¨

**Migration Progress**: 8/8 content types successfully migrated to AST-based GenericBuilder infrastructure
- âœ… **Completed**: Snippets, Wiki, Presentations, Books, Posts, Notes, Responses, Albums
- âœ… **Infrastructure**: Unified Feed System Complete
- ðŸš¨ **Critical Issue**: Presentation rendering broken - slideshows display as static content

## High Priority (Critical Functionality Fixes)

### [ ] Phase 3.5: Presentation Rendering Fix
**Project**: Website Architecture Upgrade - Presentation Slideshow Restoration  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Dependencies**: Unified Feed System Complete âœ…

**Problem**: Presentations are currently rendering as static markdown content instead of interactive reveal.js slideshows, causing significant functionality regression.

**Root Cause**: Current GenericBuilder presentation processing uses `convertMdToHtml` instead of reveal.js integration, treating slideshow content as regular markdown.

**Solution**: Implement `:::presentation` custom block system:
- Create new `:::presentation` custom block type
- Move YAML resources into presentation block metadata
- Integrate with existing reveal.js infrastructure
- Preserve slide separators (`---`) and reveal.js features
- Ensure proper slideshow navigation, themes, and interactivity

**Current vs Target**:
```markdown
<!-- Current (broken) -->
---
title: "Hello World!"
resources: [...]
---
## Slide 1
Content...
---
## Slide 2

<!-- Target (working) -->
---
title: "Hello World!"
---
:::presentation
resources:
  - text: "Personal Site"
    url: "https://luisquintanilla.me"
## Slide 1
Content...
---
## Slide 2
:::
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Presentations render as interactive reveal.js slideshows
- [ ] Slide navigation works (arrow keys, click navigation)
- [ ] Resources section displays properly
- [ ] All existing presentations work without content changes
- [ ] Integration with existing reveal.js themes and plugins
- [ ] Presentation index page shows proper slideshow previews

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] Create PresentationBlock.fs for `:::presentation` custom block
- [ ] Update GenericBuilder.PresentationProcessor to use custom blocks
- [ ] Integrate reveal.js rendering pipeline with AST processing
- [ ] Preserve existing reveal.js features (speaker notes, themes, etc.)
