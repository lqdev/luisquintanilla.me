### [Project Name] Migration Pattern Learnings (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **[Key Insight Title]**: [Detailed description of what was discovered and why it's important - demonstrates value of specific approach or reveals architectural truth]
- **[Process Discovery]**: [What worked well in the migration process - validates or improves our standard methodology]
- **[Technical Pattern]**: [Specific technical approach that proved successful - can be reused in future migrations]
- **[Risk Mitigation Success]**: [How our safety measures (feature flags, testing, etc.) prevented issues - confirms reliability of approach]
- **[Performance/Quality Gain]**: [Measurable improvements achieved - demonstrates value of the migration]
- **[Architecture Evolution]**: [How this migration fits into broader architectural improvements - shows progress toward goals]

## Template Usage Notes
- Replace [Project Name] with the actual project/content type migrated
- Replace YYYY-MM-DD with the completion date
- Focus on learnings that can inform future work
- Include both technical and process insights
- Emphasize patterns that can be reused
- Document any deviations from standard process and why
- Quantify improvements where possible (performance, code reduction, etc.)
- Connect individual learnings to broader architectural goals
