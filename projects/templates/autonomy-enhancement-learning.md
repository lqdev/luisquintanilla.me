### Autonomous Decision-Making Framework (Partnership Enhancement)
**Discovery**: User feedback revealed I was being too reactive, waiting for explicit direction instead of analyzing context and proposing logical next steps.

**Implementation**:
- **Proactive Analysis Protocol**: Always analyze current project state, identify inefficiencies, assess logical dependencies
- **Decision Framework**: GREEN (immediate action), YELLOW (propose with rationale), RED (discuss first)
- **Context-Driven Responses**: When seeing active projects, inefficiencies, or completed work, automatically suggest next steps
- **Anticipatory Problem-Solving**: Identify and address potential issues before they become blockers

**Impact**: Reduces "what do you want?" interactions, increases flow state through proactive suggestions, enables more autonomous partnership.
