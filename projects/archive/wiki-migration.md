# Wiki Content Migration Project Plan

**Project**: Phase 2 Wiki Content Migration  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Active  
**Dependencies**: âœ… Core Infrastructure, âœ… Feature Flag Infrastructure, âœ… Snippets Migration Success

## Project Overview

Migrate wiki content from existing string-based processing to new AST-based infrastructure using the validated pattern from the successful Snippets migration. This continues the systematic Phase 2 content type migrations.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Wiki uses AST parsing instead of string manipulation
- [ ] Feature flag switches between old/new wiki processing (`NEW_WIKI=true`)
- [ ] Output validation confirms 100% identical results between old and new systems
- [ ] Wiki implements `ITaggable` interface for unified tag processing
- [ ] Custom blocks work correctly in wiki content

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Analysis and Current State Assessment âœ… **COMPLETE** 
**Objective**: Understand existing wiki structure and processing using proven analysis approach

#### Tasks:
- [x] Analyze existing wiki files in `_src/wiki/`
- [x] Document current wiki metadata patterns and structure
- [x] Identify existing wiki processing functions in `Builder.fs`
- [x] Map wiki processing flow and dependencies
- [x] Test existing wiki build to establish baseline
- [x] Compare wiki structure to snippets (lessons learned)

**Duration**: 0.5 days  
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE** (2025-01-08)  
**Deliverables**:
- âœ… Current state analysis documentation
- âœ… Wiki metadata standardization plan  
- âœ… Existing vs new system comparison plan
- âœ… Baseline validation results

**CORRECTION: Key Findings**:
- **Existing System Broken**: Wiki processing functions are missing/commented out in `Program.fs`
- **Navigation Links Exist**: Site navigation includes wiki links but no content is generated
- **Infrastructure Mixed**: Both old (`Services\Markdown.fs::parseWiki`) and new (`ASTParsing.fs::parseWikiFromFile`) parsers exist
- **Standard Migration Pattern**: Need to restore/implement wiki processing with AST migration approach

### Phase 2: Restore and Migrate Wiki System
**Objective**: Restore wiki functionality and migrate to AST infrastructure using proven patterns

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement missing `buildWikiPage` and `buildWikiPages` functions in `Builder.fs`
- [ ] Create feature flag logic for old vs new wiki processing (`NEW_WIKI=true`)
- [ ] Restore basic wiki functionality using old system for baseline
- [ ] Implement new AST-based wiki processing using `GenericBuilder.WikiProcessor`
- [ ] Test parallel old/new systems with feature flag
- [ ] Create output comparison validation

**Deliverables**:
- Restored wiki build functions using old system
- New AST-based wiki processor implementation
- Feature flag integration for safe migration
- Baseline vs new system comparison setup

### Phase 2: Validation and Testing âœ… COMPLETE

**Status**: COMPLETE - 100% output compatibility confirmed

**Objectives**:
- [x] Create automated output comparison script
- [x] Test both old and new systems generate identical outputs
- [x] Fix any differences found during validation
- [x] Confirm migration readiness

**Implementation**: 
- Corrected validation script to use direct function calls instead of process spawning
- Both old and new systems built successfully 
- Generated 28 wiki files each with 100% identical output
- All wiki pages and index validated as matching

**Validation Results**:
- Total files compared: 28
- Matching files: 28 (100%)
- Differences found: 0
- **MIGRATION VALIDATION PASSED**

**Technical Notes**:
- Fixed function signatures: `loadWikis "_src"` and `buildWikis() |> ignore`
- Direct function calls more reliable than process-based testing
- Feature flag system working correctly for wiki content type
- AST-based processor produces identical output to string-based system

#### Phase 3: Production Migration âœ… COMPLETE

**Status**: COMPLETE - Wiki migration deployed to production

**Objectives**:
- [x] Switch default feature flag to use new AST-based system
- [x] Remove legacy wiki processing code  
- [x] Update documentation and changelog
- [x] Archive completed migration project

**Implementation**: 
- Updated FeatureFlags.fs to default Wiki to new processor (`| Wiki -> true`)
- Removed legacy `buildWikiPage()` and `buildWikiPages()` functions from Builder.fs
- Simplified Program.fs to use only new AST-based wiki processing
- Removed unused wiki loading code and conditional feature flag logic
- Cleaned up obsolete test scripts

**Production Deployment Results**:
- âœ… New AST-based processor is now production default
- âœ… Full site builds successfully with legacy code removed
- âœ… All 28 wiki pages + index generated correctly  
- âœ… No regression in functionality or output quality
- âœ… Codebase simplified with ~20 lines of legacy code removed

**Migration Complete**: Wiki content type now fully migrated to unified AST-based infrastructure, ready for next content type migration.

**Next Migration Ready**: Presentations content type per backlog priorities

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Wiki Processor Pattern (Based on Snippets Success)
```fsharp
let buildWikis() = 
    let wikiFiles = 
        Directory.GetFiles(Path.Join(srcDir, "wiki"))
        |> Array.filter (fun f -> f.EndsWith(".md"))
        |> Array.toList
    
    let processor = GenericBuilder.WikiProcessor.create()
    let feedData = GenericBuilder.buildContentWithFeeds processor wikiFiles
    
    // Generate individual wiki pages + index page
    // Return feed data for RSS generation
    feedData
```

### Feature Flag Integration (Proven Pattern)
```fsharp
// In Program.fs
if FeatureFlags.isEnabled ContentType.Wiki then
    // Using NEW AST-based wiki processor
    let _ = buildWikis()
    ()
else
    // Legacy string-based wiki processor
    buildWikiPage wikis
    buildWikiPages wikis
```

### ITaggable Implementation
Wiki type already has helper functions in Domain.fs - need to implement interface formally:
```fsharp
type Wiki = {
    FileName: string
    Metadata: WikiDetails
    Content: string
}
with
    interface ITaggable with
        member this.Tags = getWikiTags this
        member this.Title = getWikiTitle this
        member this.Date = getWikiDate this
        member this.FileName = getWikiFileName this
        member this.ContentType = getWikiContentType this
```

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Validated Infrastructure âœ…
- Core Infrastructure (AST parsing, custom blocks, generic builder) - Proven with Snippets
- Feature Flag Infrastructure (environment variables, validation, progress tracking) - Operational
- Output validation and comparison tools - Validated and ready
- Migration pattern - Proven successful with 100% output compatibility

### Required for Success
- Access to existing wiki content for testing
- Ability to run both old and new systems in parallel (proven capability)
- Comprehensive test coverage using validated tools

## Risk Management

### Lessons Learned from Snippets Migration
1. **Double Processing Risk**: Ensure `TextContent` returns raw markdown, not processed HTML
2. **Output Validation Critical**: Automated comparison catches compatibility issues early
3. **Feature Flag Discipline**: Maintain safe parallel operation throughout migration
4. **Directory Structure**: Ensure consistent path generation between old/new systems

### Wiki-Specific Risks
1. **Wiki Metadata Variations**: Wiki may have different metadata patterns than snippets
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive analysis phase, use proven AST parsing
2. **Custom Block Complexity**: Wiki content may use more complex custom blocks
   - **Mitigation**: Test with real content, leverage validated infrastructure
3. **Feed Generation**: Wiki RSS/HTML feeds must be identical
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven output validation tools

### Success Indicators
- Feature flag enables seamless switching (proven pattern)
- Output validation shows 100% identical results (Snippets precedent)
- All existing wiki functionality preserved
- Migration pattern further validated for remaining content types

## Timeline Estimates

Based on Snippets migration success (1 day completion):

- **Phase 1**: 1 day (Analysis - using proven approach)
- **Phase 2**: 1-2 days (Implementation - validated pattern)
- **Phase 3**: 1 day (Integration - proven infrastructure)
- **Phase 4**: 1-2 days (Validation - established tools)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (Deployment - proven workflow)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 5-7 days (1 week maximum)

## Next Steps After Completion

Upon successful completion of wiki migration:
1. Apply pattern to Presentations Migration (next in backlog)
2. Document any wiki-specific learnings for future content types
3. Update migration efficiency based on cumulative experience
4. Continue systematic migration of remaining content types

## Current Status

**Phase**: Ready to begin Phase 1 Analysis
**Infrastructure**: All systems validated and operational
**Pattern**: Proven successful with Snippets migration
**Next Action**: Begin current state analysis of wiki content

This wiki migration leverages the successful Snippets migration pattern and infrastructure, positioned for efficient and safe completion.
