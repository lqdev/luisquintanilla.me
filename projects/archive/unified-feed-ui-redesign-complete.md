## Pattern Documentation & Knowledge Capture

### Content Volume HTML Parsing Pattern (Critical Discovery)
**Discovery**: High content volumes (1000+ items) with `rawText` rendering can generate malformed HTML that breaks browser DOM parsing so severely that **no JavaScript loads at all**.
**Solution**: Progressive loading strategy with safe initial load (50 items) and chunked expansion (25 items)
**Application**: Static site generators with large content volumes require careful HTML generation

### External Library Integration Pattern (Proven)
**Pattern**: External JavaScript libraries integrate excellently with content architecture when using:
1. **Static Asset Strategy**: Copy library assets to public root (`/lib/`) for proper path resolution
2. **Container-Relative Sizing**: Use parent container dimensions (`width: 100%`) instead of viewport-based
3. **Conditional Loading**: Detect library need via DOM elements and load scripts only when required
4. **CSS Interference Minimization**: Use basic containment rules without complex overrides
5. **Layout Pattern Consistency**: External libraries work seamlessly with individual post patterns

### Progressive Loading Pattern (Proven)
**Implementation**: Server-side JSON generation + client-side chunked content rendering
**Benefits**: Handles any content volume while maintaining excellent performance and user experience
**Application**: Static sites with high content volumes requiring immediate engagement
