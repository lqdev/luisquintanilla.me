2. **Functionality Validation**: Comprehensive testing after each optimization
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Small, measurable changes with validation
4. **Rollback Capability**: Each optimization phase can be independently reverted
5. **Conservative Parallelization**: Only parallelize truly independent operations

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Processing Risks**: Race conditions, shared state issues
  - *Mitigation*: Immutable data structures, careful isolation of parallel operations
- **Memory Optimization Risks**: Premature optimization, complexity increase
