## User Stories

### Primary User Flow
**As a** user on a 2G connection or flip phone  
**I want** to access all website content efficiently  
**So that** I can read posts, browse archives, and discover content without bandwidth concerns

**As a** screen reader user  
**I want** clear navigation and semantic structure  
**So that** I can efficiently browse content and understand site organization

**As a** minimalist desktop user  
**I want** fast-loading, distraction-free content  
**So that** I can focus on reading without visual clutter or slow loading times

### Edge Cases & Secondary Flows
- **No CSS Loading**: Site remains functional and navigable without stylesheets
- **No JavaScript**: All core functionality works without scripting
- **High Zoom Levels**: Content remains accessible at 400% zoom
- **Keyboard-Only Navigation**: All functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Slow Networks**: Progressive loading with content prioritization

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Internal**: Existing F# content architecture, GenericBuilder pattern, semantic HTML foundation
- **External**: None required - pure HTML/CSS approach with optional progressive enhancement
- **Blocking**: None - can be implemented as parallel architecture

### Integration Points
- **Content Processing**: Leverage existing content types and markdown processing
- **URL Structure**: `/text/` subdirectory in `_public` with `text.lqdev.me` subdomain pointing to it
- **Feed Architecture**: Reuse existing RSS infrastructure with text-optimized templates
- **Navigation**: Text-only navigation that mirrors main site structure

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: <50KB initial page load, minimal HTTP requests
- **Compatibility**: Support basic mobile browsers and assistive technologies
- **Maintenance**: Align with existing F# architecture patterns for consistency

### Directory Structure Approach

Based on research-backed best practices, the text-only site structure will be generated in `_public/text/`:

```
_public/text/
├── index.html                 # Text-only homepage
├── about/                     # About pages in text format
│   └── index.html            # /text/about/
├── content/                   # All content in text-optimized format
│   ├── posts/                # Blog posts
│   │   ├── post-title/       # Individual post pages
│   │   │   └── index.html    # /text/content/posts/post-title/
│   │   └── index.html        # Posts listing page
│   ├── notes/                # Microblog content
│   ├── responses/            # Responses and bookmarks
│   └── [other-types]/       # Additional content types (snippets, wiki, etc.)
├── browse/                   # Content discovery and navigation
│   ├── recent/              # Latest content across all types
│   │   └── index.html        # /text/browse/recent/
│   ├── archives/            # Temporal browsing
│   │   ├── 2025/            # Year-based archives
│   │   └── index.html        # Archives index
│   └── topics/              # Tag-based browsing
│       ├── tag-name/        # Individual tag pages
│       └── index.html        # Topics index
├── feeds/                   # Text-optimized RSS feeds
│   ├── all.xml              # Combined feed
│   ├── posts.xml            # Posts feed
│   └── [type].xml           # Content type feeds
├── help/                    # Text-only site documentation
│   └── index.html           # /text/help/
└── accessibility/           # Accessibility information and tools
    └── index.html           # /text/accessibility/
```

**URL Access Patterns**:
- Primary: `lqdev.me/text/` (direct access)
- Subdomain: `text.lqdev.me` (domain provider redirect to `/text/`)
- Content: `lqdev.me/text/content/posts/post-title/` or `text.lqdev.me/content/posts/post-title/`

### Alternative Approaches Considered
- **Subdomain Approach**: `text.lqdev.me` - CHOSEN: Implemented via domain provider redirect to `/text/`
- **Build-Time Generation**: Static text-only pages in `_public/text/` - CHOSEN approach for simplicity
- **Dynamic Content Filtering**: Runtime text mode toggle - Too complex for target users
- **Separate Repository**: Independent text site - Would duplicate content management

## Research-Based Decisions & Technical Approach

### Format Decision: HTML vs Plain Text Analysis
**Research Conclusion**: HTML is strongly recommended over plain text files for the following critical reasons:

**Accessibility Excellence**:
- Screen readers require semantic HTML structure (headings, landmarks, lists) for efficient navigation
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance depends on proper HTML markup and skip links
- Plain text forces linear reading, eliminating beneficial navigation patterns for assistive technology users

**Search Engine Optimization**:
- Plain text files cannot implement title tags, meta descriptions, or structured data
- Internal linking (impossible in .txt files) is essential for content discoverability and SEO
- HTML semantic structure helps search engines understand content hierarchy and relationships

**Navigation & User Experience**:
- HTML enables cross-linking between content, table of contents, and section navigation
- Users can bookmark specific sections and share direct links to content portions
- Progressive enhancement allows enhanced functionality when available while maintaining baseline accessibility

**RSS Feed Integration**:
- HTML content integrates naturally with RSS generation using existing feed architecture
- Semantic markup enables intelligent content summarization and metadata extraction
- Plain text creates significant limitations for automated content processing

**Scalability & Maintenance**:
- HTML leverages existing F# ViewEngine architecture and GenericBuilder patterns
- Content management systems and build tools work excellently with structured HTML
- Plain text websites become difficult to maintain and organize as content volume grows

### Resolved Technical Decisions

✅ **URL Structure**: `_public/text/` directory with `text.lqdev.me` subdomain redirect  
✅ **Content Format**: HTML with semantic markup, not plain text files  
✅ **Content Alternatives**: Inline markdown for presentations/slides, comprehensive text alternatives for visual content  
✅ **Navigation Depth**: All content types included with full categorization  
✅ **User Controls**: Minimal approach - no typography preferences, focus on universal design  
✅ **Search Implementation**: Server-generated static pages leveraging existing content architecture

### Performance & Compression Research Integration

**Size Overhead Analysis** (based on actual content testing):
- **Real-world HTML overhead**: Only 3.7% increase over plain text (229 bytes for 6KB content)
- **Post-compression impact**: Negligible - Brotli compression reduces HTML by 77-86%
- **Final size difference**: <50 bytes between plain text and semantic HTML after compression
- **Target achievement**: <50KB initial loads easily achievable with semantic HTML

**Compression Strategy**:
- **Static Brotli compression**: Implement maximum compression levels (Brotli 11) for pre-compressed files
- **Compression effectiveness**: Brotli achieves 21% better compression than gzip for HTML content
- **HTML compression benefits**: Semantic markup compresses better due to predictable tag patterns
- **HTTP overhead consideration**: 500-700 bytes per request makes compression essential for files >4KB

**Browser Performance Benefits**:
- **DOM construction efficiency**: Semantic HTML enables faster browser parsing and rendering
- **CSS processing optimization**: Semantic selectors reduce computational overhead vs. complex div structures
- **Memory usage**: Semantic HTML requires less memory than equivalent div-based structures with extensive classes
- **Mobile optimization**: Reduced processing requirements benefit battery life and performance on constrained devices
