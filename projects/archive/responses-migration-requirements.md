# Responses Migration Requirements

**Project**: Website Architecture Upgrade - Responses Processor
**Created**: 2025-07-12
**Status**: Active Development

## Project Overview

Transform responses content from legacy string-based processing to AST-based GenericBuilder infrastructure, enabling enhanced IndieWeb features while maintaining 100% compatibility across 1450+ response files.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Processing Requirements
- **FR-001**: ResponseProcessor must process all response types (reply, bookmark, star, share)
- **FR-002**: AST parsing must preserve all ResponseDetails metadata fields
- **FR-003**: Response content must support markdown-to-HTML conversion
- **FR-004**: Custom blocks (especially `:::rsvp`) must be available in responses
- **FR-005**: Target URL functionality must be preserved for webmention support

### IndieWeb Compatibility Requirements  
- **FR-006**: Microformat h-entry markup must be preserved for all response types
- **FR-007**: Response type classification must remain accurate (reply/bookmark/star/share)
- **FR-008**: Webmention functionality must continue working with responses
- **FR-009**: RSVP block rendering must integrate with existing event response workflow
- **FR-010**: Response metadata must support IndieWeb datetime formats

### Integration Requirements
- **FR-011**: Homepage must continue displaying recent responses correctly
- **FR-012**: Tag pages must include responses in unified tag processing
- **FR-013**: RSS feed generation must maintain exact XML structure for `/feed/responses/`
- **FR-014**: Response cards must render correctly in all contexts (homepage, tags, feeds)
- **FR-015**: Search and filtering functionality must continue working

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Processing 1450+ responses must complete within reasonable time
- **NFR-002**: RSS feed generation should show measurable efficiency improvements
- **NFR-003**: Response parsing must not significantly impact overall build time
- **NFR-004**: Memory usage must remain within acceptable limits for large response collections

### Reliability Requirements
- **NFR-005**: 100% content preservation across all existing responses
- **NFR-006**: Zero regression in any existing response functionality  
- **NFR-007**: Feature flag system must provide instant rollback capability
- **NFR-008**: Migration must be reversible without data loss

### Maintainability Requirements
- **NFR-009**: ResponseProcessor must follow established GenericBuilder pattern
- **NFR-010**: Code must eliminate legacy response processing duplication
- **NFR-011**: Response handling must integrate with unified tag processing system
- **NFR-012**: Custom block support must be extensible for future IndieWeb features

## Technical Constraints

### Architecture Constraints
- **TC-001**: Must use existing ASTParsing.parseResponseFromFile function
- **TC-002**: Must integrate with current FeatureFlags.fs infrastructure
- **TC-003**: Must preserve existing ResponseDetails and Response domain types
- **TC-004**: Must maintain compatibility with current RSS service implementation

### IndieWeb Constraints
- **TC-005**: Must preserve all microformat classes for proper webmention support
- **TC-006**: Response types must map correctly to IndieWeb post types
- **TC-007**: Target URLs must remain functional for webmention validation
- **TC-008**: RSVP functionality must enhance rather than replace existing response types

### Content Constraints
- **TC-009**: All 1450+ existing response files must process without modification
- **TC-010**: Response content with special characters and markup must render correctly
- **TC-011**: Response metadata edge cases must be handled gracefully
- **TC-012**: Large response collections must process efficiently

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- [ ] All response types (reply, bookmark, star, share) process correctly
- [ ] RSVP blocks render properly in response content
- [ ] Homepage displays recent responses without changes
- [ ] Tag pages include responses in unified processing
- [ ] RSS feeds generate with identical structure and content

### Technical Success  
- [ ] ResponseProcessor implements complete GenericBuilder pattern
- [ ] Legacy response processing functions removed from Services\Markdown.fs
- [ ] NEW_RESPONSES feature flag controls migration safely
- [ ] AST-based processing shows performance improvements
- [ ] Code reduction achieved through elimination of duplicated logic

### Quality Success
- [ ] Zero regression in existing response functionality
- [ ] 100% content preservation validated across all responses
- [ ] Microformat markup preserved for IndieWeb compatibility
- [ ] Build process remains stable with new processor
- [ ] Response rendering quality maintained across all contexts

### Project Success
- [ ] 7th successful content migration completed using proven pattern
- [ ] Architecture consolidation: all major content types use GenericBuilder
- [ ] Documentation updated with response migration learnings
- [ ] Project properly archived following copilot instruction protocols

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Acceptance
- **UA-001**: Website visitors see no difference in response display or functionality
- **UA-002**: RSS feed subscribers receive identical content structure  
- **UA-003**: IndieWeb tools continue to parse responses correctly
- **UA-004**: Webmention systems can process response target URLs normally

### Developer Acceptance  
- **DA-001**: Response content can leverage full custom block ecosystem
- **DA-002**: New response features can be added through standard AST processing
- **DA-003**: Response maintenance uses same patterns as other content types
- **DA-004**: Legacy response code complexity eliminated from codebase

### System Acceptance
- **SA-001**: Build process completes successfully with new ResponseProcessor
- **SA-002**: Response processing performance meets or exceeds legacy system
- **SA-003**: Memory and resource usage remains within acceptable bounds
- **SA-004**: Response validation passes all automated tests

## Risk Mitigation Plans

### Content Volume Risk
- **Plan**: Implement incremental validation with representative samples
- **Trigger**: Performance degradation with full response collection
- **Response**: Optimize parsing logic or implement batched processing

### IndieWeb Compatibility Risk
- **Plan**: Specific validation scripts for microformat preservation
- **Trigger**: Loss of h-entry markup or webmention functionality
- **Response**: Immediate fix with specialized microformat rendering

### RSS Feed Breaking Changes Risk
- **Plan**: Hash-based validation of XML structure and content
- **Trigger**: RSS feed structure or content changes detected
- **Response**: Immediate correction to maintain RSS compatibility

### Legacy Integration Risk
- **Plan**: Comprehensive testing of homepage and tag page integration
- **Trigger**: Response display issues in existing contexts
- **Response**: Targeted fixes for integration points with fallback capability
