# Presentations Migration Requirements

## Overview

**Feature Name**: Presentations Migration to AST-Based Processing  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

## Problem Statement

### What Problem Are We Solving?
The current presentation system uses legacy string-based processing instead of the new AST-based infrastructure. This creates inconsistency across content types and prevents presentations from benefiting from:
- Unified tag processing through ITaggable interface
- Custom block support (specifically `:::venue` blocks for location metadata)
- Feature flag migration safety
- RSS feed generation through the unified system
- Consistent error handling and validation

### Who Is This For?
- **Content Creators**: Easier presentation metadata management with venue support
- **Site Visitors**: Better structured presentation information with venue details
- **Developers**: Consistent processing architecture across all content types
- **System Maintainers**: Unified codebase reducing maintenance burden

### Why Now?
- Dependencies met: Wiki Migration completed successfully with proven pattern
- Infrastructure ready: AST parsing and feature flags already implemented
- Small scope: Only 3 presentation files, low migration risk
- Foundation building: Presentations are next in the systematic content type migration sequence

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Core Requirements)
- [ ] Presentations use AST-based processing instead of string-based
- [ ] 100% output compatibility validated (old vs new system identical)
- [ ] ITaggable interface implemented for unified tag processing
- [ ] `NEW_PRESENTATIONS=true` feature flag controls migration
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved (Reveal.js integration, resources, navigation)
- [ ] Zero regression in build process or generated content
- [ ] Legacy code removed after validation

### Should Have (Important Features)
- [ ] Enhanced PresentationDetails with tags and date fields
- [ ] Presentation feeds generated through unified RSS system
- [ ] Consistent error handling and validation
- [ ] Test scripts for output comparison and validation
- [ ] Migration documentation following established pattern

### Could Have (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Presentation card rendering improvements
- [ ] Additional metadata fields (speaker, duration, audience)
- [ ] Improved navigation and discoverability

### Won't Have (Explicitly Out of Scope)
- [ ] Changes to Reveal.js presentation rendering (preserve existing)
- [ ] Major UI/UX changes to presentation display
- [ ] `:::venue` custom blocks for presentation location metadata (future iteration)
- [ ] `:::venue` custom blocks for location metadata - deferred to future iteration
- [ ] Advanced venue features (mapping, calendar integration) - reserved for Phase 5
- [ ] Migration of other content types - focused only on presentations

## User Stories

### Primary User Flow
**As a** content creator  
**I want** to add tag metadata to my presentations  
**So that** presentations can be categorized and discovered through the unified tag system

**As a** site visitor  
**I want** to see presentations listed in RSS feeds  
**So that** I can stay updated on new presentation content

**As a** developer  
**I want** presentations to use the same AST-based processing as other content types  
**So that** the codebase is consistent and maintainable

### Edge Cases & Secondary Flows
- Migration with empty or minimal metadata presentations
- Presentations without tag information (should work without tags)
- Feature flag switching between old and new systems during migration
- RSS feed generation for presentations (new capability)
- Tag processing for presentations that don't currently have tags

## Technical Requirements

### Domain Enhancements
- Add `tags` and `date` fields to PresentationDetails
- Implement ITaggable interface for Presentation type
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing metadata

### Processor Implementation  
- Create presentation processor using GenericBuilder pattern
- Implement presentation card and RSS renderers
- Add feature flag integration to Program.fs
- Follow established migration pattern from Snippets/Wiki

### Migration Safety
- Feature flag controls old vs new processing
- Output validation ensures identical results
- Rollback capability through environment variables
- Comprehensive testing before legacy removal

## Acceptance Criteria

### Migration Validation
- [ ] All 3 presentation files generate identical output between old and new systems
- [ ] Build process completes successfully with new processor
- [ ] Navigation and links work correctly
- [ ] Reveal.js slide functionality preserved

### Feature Functionality
- [ ] Presentations can include `:::venue` blocks
- [ ] Venue information renders correctly in HTML
- [ ] Tag processing works through ITaggable interface
- [ ] RSS feeds generated for presentations

### Code Quality
- [ ] No compilation errors or warnings
- [ ] Test scripts validate functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with changes
- [ ] Legacy code removed after validation

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies Met
- ✅ Core Infrastructure (AST parsing, custom blocks) - Complete
- ✅ Feature Flag Infrastructure - Complete  
- ✅ GenericBuilder pattern - Complete
- ✅ ITaggable interface - Complete
- ✅ Migration pattern - Validated through Snippets/Wiki

### Content Dependencies
- ✅ Wiki Migration Success - Completed with 100% compatibility
- ✅ Small content set - Only 3 presentation files
- ✅ Simple metadata structure - Easy to enhance

## Risks & Mitigation

### Low Risk Factors
- **Small Content Set**: Only 3 files to migrate
- **Proven Pattern**: Following validated Snippets/Wiki approach
- **Infrastructure Ready**: All supporting systems complete
- **Feature Flags**: Safe rollback capability

### Potential Issues & Mitigation
- **Reveal.js Integration**: Preserve existing slide rendering exactly
- **Resource Links**: Ensure presentation resources remain functional
- **Navigation**: Verify menu and linking structure unchanged
- **Build Process**: Test thoroughly to avoid breaking existing workflow

## Timeline

**Week 1**: Complete migration with all phases
- **Days 1-2**: Domain enhancement (tags/date fields and ITaggable)
- **Days 3-4**: Processor implementation and feature flag integration  
- **Days 5-6**: Migration validation and testing
- **Day 7**: Production deployment and legacy code removal

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All success criteria met
- [ ] 100% output compatibility validated
- [ ] Feature flag controls migration
- [ ] Test scripts validate functionality
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Legacy code removed
- [ ] Project archived following workflow
