# Architecture Refactor 2026 — Phased Execution Plan

**Project**: Streamlining the F#/.NET static site generator
**Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Large (phased into S/M/L independently-shippable units)
**Source assessment**: [`docs/architecture-assessment-2026.md`](../../docs/architecture-assessment-2026.md) — findings F1–F11, bets B1–B4
**Status**: `[>]` Active — Phase 0 complete; **Phase 1 complete** (1.1–1.5 done, all byte-identical); **Phase 2 in progress** (2.1 build driver complete — all 11/11 builders migrated, byte-identical; 2.2 generic `toUnified` complete — 8 converters collapsed, byte-identical; 2.3 view dedupe complete — post-cards/response-bodies/layouts consolidated, byte-identical; 2.4 F7 slice (a) complete — `cleanCardHtml` unifies 4 copies, byte-identical; slice (b) STJ swap deferred to B2)
**Last updated**: 2026-06-10

> Read the assessment first. This plan is the *how/when*; the assessment is the *what/why*

## Operating Rules (apply to every phase)

1. **Git**: long-lived umbrella branch `refactor/architecture-2026`. Work branches squash-merge
   into the umbrella (one logical change per squash = one-revert rollback). Umbrella merges to
   `main` with a **merge commit** (never squash), then fast-forward umbrella back to stay even.
2. **Output contract**: Phases 1–2 must produce **byte-identical `_public/` output** (verified
   via baseline snapshot diff) unless a step explicitly says "reviewed diff". Phase 3 bets are
   reviewed-diff territory by design.
3. **Build gate**: `dotnet build` clean (the single pre-existing `FS1104` warning in
   `ActivityPubBuilder.fs` is expected) + `dotnet run` completes after *every* commit-able unit.
4. **Stop-the-line**: any unexplained output diff halts the step; investigate or revert. Never
   stack a second change on an unverified first one.
5. **Conventions**: type-first (`Domain.fs`), ViewEngine over sprintf, module-per-concern,
   fully-qualified types, functions ≤20 lines where practical, `.fsproj` compile order updated
   with any new file.
6. **Composition over inheritance** (assessment §8.1): vary behavior with records of
   functions, higher-order functions, and generics — never new abstract classes or interface
   hierarchies (subclassing only where a host library's extension API demands it, e.g. Markdig
   in `CustomBlocks.fs`). Corollary: extract-and-compose beats boolean flags.
7. **Diagnostics contract** (assessment §8.3): success output stays terse; failures print
   structured, self-contained blocks (file → got/expected → `fix:` pointer). From step 2.8
   onward, any `| Error _ -> ...` that discards the error value is a review-blocker.

### Verification harness (used everywhere)

```powershell
# 1. Baseline (once per phase start, from clean main/umbrella):
dotnet run                          # generates _public/
Copy-Item _public _public_baseline -Recurse

# 2. After each change:
dotnet build && dotnet run

# 3. Compare (byte-identical expectation):
# Hash every file in both trees and diff the manifests
Get-ChildItem _public -Recurse -File | ForEach-Object {
  [pscustomobject]@{ Path = $_.FullName.Substring((Resolve-Path _public).Path.Length); Hash = (Get-FileHash $_.FullName -Algorithm SHA256).Hash }
} | Sort-Object Path | Export-Csv after.csv
# (same for _public_baseline -> before.csv) ; then:
Compare-Object (Import-Csv before.csv) (Import-Csv after.csv) -Property Path, Hash
# Expect: no output. Any row = investigate.
```

Note: if any build steps embed timestamps/nondeterminism, identify them in Phase 0 and exclude
those files from the byte-identical contract explicitly (documented list, reviewed once).

**Documented nondeterminism exclusions (from Phase 0.4 — the complete list):**
- `resources/ai-memex/graph.json` — only `stats.generatedAt` (UTC build timestamp;
  `KnowledgeGraph.fs:527`) varies between runs; graph structure is deterministic. Exclude this
  one file from the byte-identical diff (the harness `Compare-Object` should filter
  `Path -ne '\resources\ai-memex\graph.json'`), or strip/normalize `generatedAt` before hashing.
  No other file in the 13,486-file tree is nondeterministic (RSS feeds included).

## Executor Recipe — how to run any step (read once; applies to every step)

Audience: **any executor with zero prior context** — a junior developer or an AI agent. Each
step below is a self-contained task; this recipe is the shared choreography, kept here once so
the steps stay terse. Phases 0–1 are executable as written; Phase 2 steps become mechanical
after their pilots (see the Phase 2 preamble); Phase 3 bets are decision-gated and are *not*
junior tasks until their go/no-go note is written.

1. **Start**: `git checkout refactor/architecture-2026 && git pull`, then create a work branch
   `git checkout -b refactor/<step-id>` (e.g. `refactor/1.3-content-types`).
2. **Read first**: the step's linked assessment finding (its F-number) — it carries the *why*
   and exact file:line evidence. Don't start a step you can't restate in one sentence.
3. **Implement exactly the step's scope.** Out-of-scope discoveries go in the ledger Notes
   column — never fixed opportunistically (stop-the-line, rule 4).
4. **Universal Definition of Done** (every step, in addition to its own **Verify** line):
   - [ ] `dotnet build` clean — only `FS1104` expected (and from 1.5 onward, FS0025 is an error)
   - [ ] `dotnet run` completes
   - [ ] Hash-manifest diff vs baseline is empty — or the step explicitly says "reviewed diff",
         in which case attach the diff summary to the PR/commit message
   - [ ] The step's own **Verify** line satisfied
   - [ ] Status Ledger row updated (status, dates, notes)
5. **Merge**: squash into the umbrella with message `refactor(<step-id>): <summary>`.
6. **Rollback** (any time): `git revert <squash-sha>` — one squash per step keeps this always
   true.
7. **Stuck or surprised**: stop. Record what you saw in the ledger Notes, ask the author.
   Never stack a second change on an unverified first one.

## Phase 0 — Safety Harness (S; prerequisite for all)

**Goal**: a trustworthy baseline + rollback rails. No production code changes.

**Status: COMPLETE (2026-06-10).** Umbrella branch `refactor/architecture-2026` created from
clean `main` (after committing an FSharp.Core lock bump 10.1.300→10.1.301 — the local SDK
forces it; `dotnet restore --locked-mode` failed with NU1004 until regenerated via
`--force-evaluate`, then committed so `main` builds reproducibly).

- [x] 0.1 Umbrella branch `refactor/architecture-2026` created from up-to-date `main`.
- [x] 0.2 `dotnet build -c Release`: **succeeded in 14.9s**. `dotnet run -c Release` (full site
      generation): **~110s**, **13,486 files** in `_public/`. (Baseline metrics for Phase 1.1 delta.)
- [x] 0.3 Snapshot `_public/` → `_public_baseline/` (gitignored — added `_public_baseline/`,
      `_public_second/`, `before.csv`, `after.csv` to `.gitignore`).
- [x] 0.4 Second fresh `dotnet run` + SHA-256 hash-manifest diff over all 13,486 files:
      **exactly ONE nondeterministic file** — `resources/ai-memex/graph.json`. Sole varying field
      is `stats.generatedAt` (a UTC build timestamp; source `KnowledgeGraph.fs:527`,
      `let now = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToString("o")`, emitted at `:543`). The graph structure
      (nodes/edges/clusters/counts) is byte-identical; only the timestamp differs. RSS feeds and
      everything else are already deterministic. **Documented contract exclusion (the only one):**
      `resources/ai-memex/graph.json`. The verification harness must exclude this single file
      (or normalize/strip `generatedAt`) from the byte-identical comparison in Phases 1–2.
- [x] 0.5 `OutputComparison.fs` confirmed present and usable (`compareOutputs`/`validateOutputs`,
      MD5 + line-level diff) as an alternative to the PowerShell harness. The PowerShell hash
      harness is the primary tool (it found 0.4's exclusion); `OutputComparison.fs` is the
      in-repo fallback.
- [x] 0.6 Warning inventory: **exactly 1** warning — `FS1104` at `ActivityPubBuilder.fs:805`
      (the documented expected one), **zero FS0025**. Precondition proof for step 1.5 holds.

**Done when**: two consecutive builds diff clean (modulo documented exclusions); baseline time
recorded; umbrella branch pushed. ✅ **Met** — clean modulo the single `graph.json` exclusion;
baseline build 14.9s / generate ~110s / 13,486 files recorded; umbrella branch pushed.

---

## Phase 1 — Conservative Quick Wins (S–M; output byte-identical; GREEN-zone)

Independent steps; each is its own squash commit. Order chosen so each speeds up the next.

### 1.1 Kill the double-builds (F3) — ✅ DONE (2026-06-10)

**Result: byte-identical output verified** (modulo the documented `graph.json` exclusion).
Implemented in three independently hash-verified sub-steps:
- **B (converters bound once)**: all 12 `convertXToUnified` results bound to `let` values
  immediately after the `FeedData` captures; `timelineFeedItems` / `allUnifiedItems` /
  `blogArchiveFeedItems` now reference the bindings (posts/notes/responses no longer convert 3×).
- **A (duplicate builder calls)**: deleted **4 of 5** `let _ = buildX()` duplicates
  (`buildPresentations`, `buildSnippets`, `buildWikis`, `buildMedia`).
  **`buildBooks()` duplicate RETAINED** — discovered entanglement: `StarRating` SVG gradient IDs
  come from a **global mutable counter** (`BlockRenderers.fs:85`, also `CustomBlocks.fs:454`), so
  the shipped review pages' IDs depend on this being the last render pass. Removing it is
  cosmetic-only (IDs shift `halfGrad16`→`halfGrad5`) but breaks byte-identity. Eliminating this
  last duplicate requires making the gradient IDs page-local/deterministic first — **logged for
  the StarRating cleanup (relates to F7/B2)**. An explanatory comment marks the retained call.
- **C (re-parse dedup)**: removed the top-of-`main` `loadPosts`/`responses` re-parses and the
  **dead** `feedNotes` binding (referenced only in a commented-out line); `posts`/`responses` for
  tag pages now derive from `postsFeedData`/`responsesFeedData`. Confirms `loadPosts` and the
  `PostProcessor` path produce equivalent tag-page output.
- **Timing**: build ~15s (unchanged — compilation). Generation wall-clock is I/O- and
  entity-extraction-dominated and noisy across single samples (~110–135s); the F3 win is the
  removal of redundant work, not a guaranteed wall-clock drop.
- **Verify**: ✅ byte-identical. **Rollback**: one revert of the 1.1 squash commit.

### 1.2 Remove the dead tag-system flag (F4) — ✅ DONE (2026-06-10)
- `Program.fs`: deleted `useUnifiedTagSystem` flag + the unreachable `else` branch; the unified
  tag path now runs unconditionally.
- `Builder.fs`: deleted the now-orphaned legacy `buildTagsPages` (grep-verified single caller was
  the deleted `else`). Cascade-removed its exclusively-used helpers: `individualTagView`
  (`Views/TagViews.fs`) + its `Views/Partials.fs` re-export, and `processTaggedPost`,
  `processTaggedResponse`, `getTagsFromPost`, `getTagsFromResponse` (`Services/Tag.fs`). Kept
  `processTagName` (shared) and the `*Unified` views/processing (live path).
- **Net −150 lines** of dead code. **Verify**: ✅ byte-identical; build clean.
  **Rollback**: one revert of the 1.2 squash.

### 1.3 Introduce the ContentType source of truth (F5 — step 1 of 2) — ✅ DONE (2026-06-10)
- New `ContentTypes.fs` (compiles right after `Domain.fs`): `[<Literal>]` canonical names
  (Posts/Notes/Responses/Bookmarks/Snippets/Wiki/Presentations/Reviews/Media/Streams/AiMemex/
  AlbumCollection/PlaylistCollection), response-subtype literals (Reply/Reshare/Star/Rsvp/Bookmark)
  + `ResponseSubtypes` set + `normalizeResponseSubtype`, and `urlPrefix` (the permalink table
  lifted verbatim from `LayoutViews.fs`).
- Mechanically swapped literals → `ContentTypes.*` in: all `GenericBuilder` `convert*ToUnified`
  ContentType stamps; the `typeConfigurations` RSS feed cluster (tuple keys + `Some ct`); the
  `buildJsonFeeds` typeConfigs + `responseStreamContentTypes` set + `toJsonFeedContent` match;
  the responses-feed subtype filter (`[star;reply;reshare;responses]`, order preserved); the
  `<> ai-memex` syndication guards; bookmark response-subtype comparisons; the two
  `LayoutViews` permalink matches (now call `ContentTypes.urlPrefix`); and the three Program.fs
  feed-item lists (`timeline`/`allUnified`/`blogArchive`) + the ActivityPub `<> ai-memex` guard.
- **Deliberately NOT touched** (deferred to 2.7/B1 — *behavior* decisions, not mechanical):
  `allTaggableContent`'s `"wikis"` (plural) key — differs from the feed vocab's `"wiki"`; changing
  it would alter output. Builder.fs path/dir literals (filesystem-layout concern, not
  `UnifiedFeedItem.ContentType` identity). `ITaggable.ContentType` singular values.
- Honest scope: `[<Literal>]`s erase to `string` → **documentation, not enforcement**. The
  closed-DU enforcement upgrade is 2.7; this just collects the scatter so that swap is mechanical.
- **Verify**: ✅ byte-identical (0 diffs). Build clean (1 expected FS1104). **Rollback**: one revert.

### 1.4 Build summary for skipped files (F8 — interim diagnostics only) — ✅ DONE (2026-06-10)
- Added skip reporting in `GenericBuilder.buildContentWithFeeds` — the universal choke point all
  12 content builders (+ Loaders.fs) route through, so one edit covers every type with zero
  call-site churn (no label param → scripts/tests untouched). Partition parsed vs skipped; if any
  parse returned `None`, print `⚠ N file(s) skipped (… content omitted …):` + each skipped path
  (the path conveys the content type). Restructured `List.choose` → `List.map` + `List.choose snd`;
  the returned `FeedData` list is element- and order-identical.
- **Verify**: ✅ byte-identical (0 diffs). Full regenerate emitted **zero** skip lines (every `.md`
  parses today) → no output noise in the common case and no hidden intentional-`None` cases.
- **Interim only** — typed accumulation + fix-hint blocks + `--strict` is step 2.8. **Rollback**: one revert.

### 1.5 Compiler strictness: incomplete matches become build errors — ✅ DONE (2026-06-10)
- `PersonalSite.fsproj`: added `<WarningsAsErrors>FS0025</WarningsAsErrors>`.
- **Verify**: build clean — exactly 1 warning (FS1104) and **0 FS0025**, so the flag fires on
  nothing today. Byte-identity holds **by construction**: a diagnostic-*severity* flag with zero
  matching instances cannot change the emitted assembly, hence cannot change `_public/` (full
  hash-verify deferred to 1.4, which is the step that actually adds code). **Rollback**: one revert.
- Why it matters: the payoff compounds after 2.7 — adding a case to the closed `ContentType` DU
  turns every non-updated `match` into a **compile error**, making the compiler the
  add-a-content-type checklist. Note: a wildcard `_` branch satisfies FS0025 while defeating it —
  the no-wildcard review discipline (operating rule 7 / assessment §7) stays in force.

**Phase 1 done when**: all five steps merged to umbrella, each hash-verified; build-time delta
recorded; umbrella merged to `main` (merge commit) if desired at this checkpoint.

---

## Phase 2 — Balanced Consolidation (M–L; flag-gated; output byte-identical per migrated unit)

Items independent of each other — cherry-pick order, though 2.1→2.2 is the natural pairing and
**2.8 requires 2.1**. Each unit: implement alongside old path → flag/parallel-compare → cut
over → delete old path.

**Junior-readiness strategy — pilot-then-mechanical**: each consolidation's first instance
(the pilot) is done carefully once and reviewed; every subsequent instance copies the pilot
commit as a literal template. The pilots are the skilled work; the repetitions are
deliberately mechanical.

### 2.1 Generic build driver (F1)
- New `ContentTypeBuild<'T>` record + `buildContentType` driver in a new `BuildDriver.fs`
  (insert in `.fsproj` after `GenericBuilder.fs`). Skeleton (assessment F1 + §8.1–8.2; final
  shape at pilot):
  ```fsharp
  type ContentTypeBuild<'T> = {
      Name: string                                  // ContentTypes literal (1.3)
      SourceDir: string list                        // e.g. ["resources"; "snippets"]
      OutputDir: string list
      Processor: GenericBuilder.ContentProcessor<'T>
      ItemView: 'T -> 'T array -> XmlNode           // item + siblings
      IndexView: 'T array -> XmlNode
      IndexTitle: string
      ItemTitle: 'T -> string
      SortIndex: ('T array -> 'T array) option      // wikis sort by title; None = source order
  }

  /// Composition of small named phases (assessment §8.1), born Result-aware (§8.2):
  /// enumerate → parseAll → sort → renderAll → writeAll → report
  /// parseAll keeps the failure track (ASTParsing.ParseError) instead of dropping it.
  let buildContentType (cfg: ContentTypeBuild<'T>)
      : GenericBuilder.FeedData<'T> list * (string * ASTParsing.ParseError) list = ...
  ```
  Until 2.8 lands, the returned failure list feeds the 1.4 reporter (same output); 2.8 then
  upgrades it to `ContentError` blocks without re-touching the eleven call sites.
- Migration order (easiest→hardest, two pilots prove the driver):
  1. `buildSnippets` (pilot 1 — simplest clone)
  2. `buildWikis` (pilot 2 — proves `SortIndex` variation)
  3. `buildPosts`, `buildNotes`, `buildResponses`, `buildBookmarks`
  4. `buildPresentations`, `buildBooks` (proves no-tags variation)
  5. `buildMedia`, `buildAlbumCollections`, `buildPlaylistCollections` (most bespoke — if the
     driver needs >2 new config fields to absorb one of these, STOP and leave that builder
     hand-written with a comment; do not force the abstraction. 9/11 migrated is success.)
- Per type: add config; run driver in place of old function; hash-verify; squash; next.
- **Prior art** (researched via DeepWiki): ionide/Fornax drives generation from
  `GeneratorConfig` records (`Trigger`/`OutputFile` DUs) — the generators-as-data pattern is
  proven in mature F# SSGs; we add what Fornax lacks (compiled domain types per content type).
- **Capstone**: when all migrated, old per-type functions deleted; `Builder.fs` shrinks ~400 lines.
- **ADR-0006** written when pilot 2 proves the design (use `docs/adr/template.md`).
- **Rollback**: per-type revert; driver itself reverts cleanly if pilots fail.

**STATUS: COMPLETE (byte-identical, 0 diffs each step).** Shipped `BuildDriver.fs`
(`ContentTypeBuild<'T>` + `buildContentType`), inserted after `Views/Generator.fs`
(not after `GenericBuilder.fs` — the driver calls `ViewGenerator.generate`, so it must
compile after Generator.fs and before Builder.fs). **All 11/11 builders migrated**
(exceeded the 9/11 target; STOP rule never triggered). Deviations from the sketch above,
all deliberate:
- Index fields grouped into an **optional** `Index: IndexConfig<'T> option` (View/Title/Sort)
  so `buildBookmarks` can declare `Index = None` (its landing page comes from responses).
  This absorbed the only "no-index" case without a new top-level field.
- Driver guards the source dir with `Directory.Exists` → `[]` (preserves albums/playlists safety).
- `media`/`album`/`playlist` use an AST-rendered `ItemView` by closing over a pre-bound
  `processor` (`processor.Render content |> convertMdToHtml`).
- **Return type kept as `GenericBuilder.FeedData<'T> list`** (NOT the `* ParseError list`
  tuple sketched above). The railway/Result-aware upgrade is deferred to **2.8**, which will
  change the driver's return shape in one place without re-touching the 11 call sites.
- ADR-0006 written and indexed.

### 2.2 Generic `toUnified` (F2)
- Add `UnifiedExtras` defaults + generic projection (assessment F2 sketch). Collapse the ~10
  trivial converters; keep explicit small projections for responses / bookmarks / books / albums
  (their divergence is the documentation).
- Hash-verify per converter swapped. **Rollback**: per-converter revert.

**STATUS: COMPLETE (byte-identical, 0 diffs vs umbrella tip).** Added private
`UnifiedExtras` record + `defaultExtras`, `arrayTags`/`splitTags` helpers, and a generic
`toUnified (contentType) (getCore: FeedData<'T> -> string*string*string*string[]) (getExtras: FeedData<'T> -> UnifiedExtras) feedDataList`
in `GenericBuilder.fs`. Collapsed **8** trivial converters (posts, notes, snippets, wikis,
ai-memex, presentations, album-collections, playlist-collections). Kept **6** explicit
(responses, responseBookmarks, bookmarkResponses, books, albums, bookmarks) — genuine
divergence (dynamic ContentType from response subtype + filters; CardHtml + ReviewData;
MediaData; TargetUrl from BookmarkOf). F# gotcha: annotate the `getCore` lambda param
`(fun (fd: FeedData<X>) -> …)` so `'T` pins before the lambda body is checked.

### 2.3 View dedupe (F6)
- `postCardView` parameterized by `(feedKey: string, withWebmention: bool)` replaces
  `feedPostView`/`notePostView`/`individualFeedPostView`/`individualNotePostView`
  (`ContentViews.fs:145–196`).
- `responseBodyView (style: ResponseStyle) (post: Response)` where
  `ResponseStyle = { Icon: string; Color: string; MfClass: string }` derived from response type
  replaces the five bodies (`ContentViews.fs:24–142`). The shared cleanup/timestamp-strip moves
  to ONE helper (interim — B2 deletes it entirely later).
- Collapse `defaultLayout`/`defaultIndexedLayout` (`Layouts.fs:414–560`) into one function with
  an asset-bundle parameter (e.g. `includeReveal: bool`).
- Collection-view consolidation only where genuinely identical (resist over-abstracting).
- Hash-verify per view swapped. **Rollback**: per-view revert.

**STATUS: COMPLETE (byte-identical, 0 diffs).** `postCardView (feedKey) (withWebmention)`
replaces the four post/note bodies (4 named wrappers retained for call sites). Four
response bodies (reply/reshare/star/bookmark) fold into `responseBodyView (style: ResponseStyle)`
+ a shared `cleanResponseContent` helper; **`rsvpBodyView` kept explicit** (p-rsvp span +
" to " + `target=_blank` is genuine divergence — same "divergence is the documentation"
rule as 2.2). `defaultLayout`/`defaultIndexedLayout` collapse to a private `layoutCore
(includeReveal: bool)` with two named wrappers. **SEO note resolved**: both layouts always
emitted `<meta robots=nosnippet>`; the misleading "allows indexing" comment was corrected
in place (nosnippet permits indexing, suppresses snippets) — markup unchanged to preserve
byte-identity; any actual robots change is a separate content decision, not this refactor.

### 2.4 F7 cheap slices (full fix is B2)
- Extract the duplicated regex cleaning block into a single named function `cleanCardHtml` with
  a comment pointing at B2. One copy of the fragility instead of N.
- ~~Replace the `sprintf`-built progressive-loading JSON + hand `escapeJson` with
  `System.Text.Json`.~~ **Moved to B2** (decision 2026-06-11) — see below.
- **Rollback**: per-slice revert.

**STATUS: slice (a) COMPLETE (byte-identical, 0 diffs); slice (b) DEFERRED to B2.**
Slice (a): `cleanCardHtml (html: string)` (private, `LayoutViews.fs`) now backs **all four**
timeline cleaning copies — two initial-render paths (one is a reviews-only `then`-branch with
a latent missing `else`, preserved as-is) and two progressive-loading JSON paths (one with a
`createSimplifiedReviewContent` branch). Helper takes already-rendered HTML so callers keep
their own `convertMdToHtml`/`createSimplifiedReviewContent` choice — that's what let it unify
all four. Byte-identical by construction (same ops, extracted).

Slice (b) — **decision: defer the STJ swap into B2, not a standalone step.** Rationale:
(1) STJ cannot be byte-identical here (it escapes `<>&`/control chars differently from the
hand `escapeJson`), so it would be the *only* byte-breaking step in an otherwise spotless
byte-identical Phase 2 — high contract cost, low marginal value once (a) removed the
duplication. (2) B2 introduces `RenderedContent` and rewrites this JSON-assembly path anyway;
the JSON will be serialized from a typed record there, making STJ the natural serializer and
folding its non-byte-identical diff into B2's single ADR + parity-harness review. (3) The
current escaper is correct and localized — safe to carry until the structural rewrite subsumes
it. (Agreement: hand-rolled JSON escaping is a smell; STJ is the right end state, just timed
with B2.)

### 2.5 Module splits (F9 — after 2.1/2.2 shrink things)
- Lift `UnifiedFeeds` out of `GenericBuilder.fs` → `UnifiedFeeds.fs` (insert in `.fsproj` after
  `GenericBuilder.fs`). Pure move; qualified names keep call sites valid.
- Lift timeline views out of `LayoutViews.fs` → `Views/TimelineViews.fs` if it still exceeds
  ~800 lines post-2.3/2.4.
- Hash-verify after each move (should be trivially identical). **Rollback**: per-move revert.

### 2.6 Navigation data source of truth (F11)
- Define nav as data (the existing `NavigationStructure`/`NavigationSection` types in
  `Domain.fs:280–291` are the starting point — finish what was sketched). Both `Layouts.fs`
  navs render from it; markup stays per-renderer.
- Hash-verify. **Rollback**: one revert.

### 2.7 Closed `ContentType` DU (F5 — step 2 of 2; the enforcement upgrade)
- Replace the 1.3 literals module's *consumers* with a real closed DU
  (`[<RequireQualifiedAccess>] type ContentType = Posts | Notes | …`) + one boundary pair
  `parse : string -> ContentType option` / `serialize : ContentType -> string`. Strings survive
  only at the YAML/frontmatter and URL boundaries. A failed `parse` at the boundary produces a
  `ContentError`-style block (2.8) listing the valid set and a nearest-match hint
  (`got 'recipies' — did you mean 'recipes'?`).
- Rationale (assessment F5 + §7; researched: F# style guide, Wlaschin "Designing with types"):
  of alias / single-case DU / UMX / closed DU, only the closed DU buys **exhaustiveness** —
  adding `| Recipes` later makes the compiler enumerate every match that must handle it. That
  converts the 8-file human checklist into compiler-guided errors, which is the whole point.
- **Discipline (permanent, enforce in review): no wildcard `_` branches in content-type
  matches** — a wildcard silently disables the exhaustiveness paid for here.
- Precedent in-repo: `Domain.fs:407–412` already defines `ResponseType` as a DU that the YAML
  layer bypasses with a raw string (`Domain.fs:418`). 2.7 includes wiring that existing DU in
  properly — which forces the response-subtype taxonomy decision (memex
  pattern-content-type-taxonomy-mismatch) to be made explicitly.
- Sequenced **after 2.1/2.2** so the DU lands in consolidated code (1 driver + few projections),
  not 25 clones. **Verify**: byte-identical output. **Rollback**: revert to 1.3 literals.

### 2.8 Railway parse track — reconnect the severed rail (F8 full fix; §8.2–8.3; **requires 2.1**)
- Context: `ASTParsing.fs` already returns `Result<ParsedDocument<'T>, ParseError>`
  (`ASTParsing.fs:144+`); the rail is severed at 12 `| Error _ -> None` sites
  (`GenericBuilder.fs:120…1392`). Post-2.1 the driver is the consolidated consumer — reconnect
  once, not twelve times.
- New `ContentError` DU (in `ContentTypes.fs` or a small `Diagnostics.fs` compiled early) — the
  assessment §8.3 sketch: every case carries *file*, *got*, *valid set/hint*, and a `fix:`
  pointer to the authority file:line. Includes a `render : ContentError -> string` producing
  the standard block:
  ```
  ✗ UnknownResponseType: _src/responses/foo.md
      got 'boost' — valid: reply | reshare | star | rsvp
      fix: correct 'response_type' in the file, or extend ResponseType (Domain.fs:407)
  ```
- **Accumulate, don't short-circuit**: parse all files; partition successes/failures; successes
  render as normal; failures print one block each + a one-line per-type summary. No
  `result { }` short-circuiting at the batch boundary.
- **Default behavior (decided 2026-06-10): report + exit 0** — a bad file must not block
  publishing the rest. Add opt-in strict mode (`--strict` arg or `STRICT_CONTENT=1` env) →
  exit 1 on any content error, for CI use when wanted.
- Retire the broad `try/with → continue` blocks in loaders (`Builder.fs:1635–1647` etc.) where
  the railway now covers them; 1.4's interim reporter is superseded and deleted.
- **Verify**: `_public/` byte-identical when no files fail; a deliberately-broken fixture file
  (temp, not committed) produces the structured block with exit 0, and exit 1 under strict
  mode. **Rollback**: revert; the 1.4 reporter returns.

**Phase 2 done when**: chosen units merged + verified; `Builder.fs`/`GenericBuilder.fs` line
counts re-measured and recorded vs assessment baseline; ADR-0006 committed; changelog entry per
house convention.

## Phase 3 — Ambitious Bets (each an explicit go/no-go; reviewed diffs allowed)

Rule: each bet starts with a **one-page go/no-go note** (cost, benefit, exit) appended to this
file, decided *before* code. None is pre-approved. Sequencing below is the recommended order.

### B1 — Content-type registry (capstone of F1+F5) — *recommended GO, after Phase 2*
- **What**: one record per content type unifying what Phase 1.3 + 2.1 + 2.6 built piecemeal:
  identity, feed key, URL prefix, source dir, processor, views, nav presence. Adding a post type
  = adding one registry entry + a Domain record + views (target: 8 files → ≤3 meaningful edits;
  update `.github/skills/add-content-type` checklist accordingly).
- **Why GO**: directly serves "one identity, many post types" — the author's stated growth axis.
- **Cost**: M–L (mostly rearranging Phase-2 outputs into one table). **Exit**: registry deleted,
  Phase-2 configs remain free-standing (no worse than Phase 2 end-state).

### B2 — Structured render product; delete HTML re-parsing (F7 full fix) — *go/no-go after B1*
- **What**: `ContentProcessor.Render` returns `RenderedContent` (BodyHtml without
  wrapper/title + metadata); pages/cards/timeline/text-only compose instead of regex-stripping.
  Deletes `cleanCardHtml`, timestamp regexes, review-image regex extraction.
- **Risk**: highest in plan — touches every processor + the timeline. Flag-gated
  (`RENDER_V2`), full-site reviewed diff (expect *intentional* diffs where regex was lossy).
  **ADR-0007** regardless of outcome. **Exit**: flag off; old path untouched until cutover.
- **Folds in 2.4 slice (b)** (deferred 2026-06-11): replace the progressive-loading
  `sprintf`-JSON + hand `escapeJson` (`LayoutViews.fs`) with `System.Text.Json` serializing the
  typed `RenderedContent`-derived record. Its non-byte-identical JSON diff (STJ escapes
  `<>&`/control chars differently) is reviewed inside this step's diff rather than as a lone
  byte-breaking step in byte-identical Phase 2.

### B3 — Search-contract generation (Fable compiler pilot: **NO-GO**, decided 2026-06-10)
- **Decision (author, 2026-06-10): the Fable-the-compiler pilot is NO-GO.** Cons in assessment
  §6 accepted: second toolchain (Node/Fable/bundler) in a pure-dotnet pipeline, bundle-weight
  risk vs the slow-web/<50KB ethos, and a future human maintainer is likelier to know vanilla
  JS than Fable. No ADR needed; assessment §6 + this entry are the record.
- **What remains adopted (optional, cheap)**: **contract generation** — emit a JSON
  Schema/types artifact from `SearchIndex.fs` at build time and validate `search.js`'s
  consumption in CI. Type-drift protection across the F#/JS boundary with zero new toolchain.
  Schedule whenever convenient; it is independent of all other bets.

### B4 — Text-only derives from the shared model (F10) — *only after/with B2*
- Re-render text-only from `RenderedContent` + shared nav data + shared subtype normalization,
  deleting `TextOnlyViews.fs:39–87` regex rewriting. Reviewed diff with explicit text-only
  parity checklist (<50KB budget re-verified per page type).

## Success Metrics (measured against Phase 0 baseline)

- [ ] 11 duplicated builders → 1 driver + ≤11 config records (≥9 migrated)
- [ ] 14 converter clones → 1 generic + ≤4 explicit projections
- [ ] 0 duplicate build executions in `Program.fs` (5 today); converters run 1× each (3× today)
- [ ] 0 dead feature flags (1 today)
- [ ] Content-type identity: single authority module (1.3) → closed DU, exhaustive matches, no wildcards (2.7)
- [ ] Railway reconnected: 12 `| Error _ -> None` sites → 0; every parse failure surfaces as a
      self-contained block (file → got/expected → fix pointer); FS0025 = compile error (1.5)
- [ ] Regex-on-generated-HTML sites: 5 clusters today → 1 (Phase 2) → 0 (if B2 lands)
- [ ] `Builder.fs` + `GenericBuilder.fs` combined: 3,728 lines today → target <2,500 (Ph 2)
- [ ] Build wall-clock: improved vs baseline (record actual numbers Phase 0 vs Phase 1.1)
- [ ] Skipped-file visibility: every silently-dropped file now reported (0 reporting today)
- [ ] Adding a content type: ~8 files today → ≤3 meaningful edits (if B1 lands); skill checklist updated
- [ ] Zero unexplained output diffs at every checkpoint; site soul untouched (no visual/UX change in Phases 0–2)

## Completion Protocol (house rules)

- Phase logs in `logs/YYYY-MM-DD-arch-refactor-phaseN-log.md` during work; summarize to
  `changelog.md` and delete logs at each phase close.
- On full completion: archive this plan to `projects/archive/`, update `docs/` references,
  write changelog entry, and propose (ask-first, per convention) an AI Memex `project-report`
  + a `pattern` entry for the generic-driver migration if it proves reusable.

## Status Ledger

| Phase | Status | Started | Completed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Safety harness | `[x]` done | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-10 | Umbrella branch created off main (after FSharp.Core lock bump 10.1.300→10.1.301 committed). Baseline: build 14.9s / generate ~110s / 13,486 files. Warnings: 1×FS1104, 0×FS0025. **Contract exclusion: `resources/ai-memex/graph.json`** (only `stats.generatedAt` build timestamp varies; `KnowledgeGraph.fs:527`). |
| 1.1 double-builds | `[x]` done | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-10 | Byte-identical. Converters bound 1×; 4/5 duplicate builder calls removed; posts/responses tag arrays derived from FeedData; dead `feedNotes` removed. **buildBooks() duplicate retained** — StarRating gradient IDs use a global counter (BlockRenderers.fs:85), removal is cosmetic-only but breaks byte-identity; needs deterministic page-local IDs first (→F7/B2). |
| 1.2 dead flag | `[x]` done | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-10 | Byte-identical. Removed `useUnifiedTagSystem` flag + unreachable `else`; deleted legacy `buildTagsPages` + 5 exclusively-used helpers. Net −150 lines. |
| 1.3 ContentTypes module | `[x]` done | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-10 | Byte-identical. New `ContentTypes.fs` literals authority; mechanical swap across GenericBuilder converters/feeds, LayoutViews permalink, Program.fs feed lists. Left `"wikis"` plural key + Builder.fs path literals for 2.7/B1. |
| 1.4 skip diagnostics | `[x]` done | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-10 | Byte-identical. Skip reporter in `buildContentWithFeeds` choke point; stdout-only, 0 skips today. interim; superseded by 2.8 |
| 1.5 FS0025 → error | `[x]` done | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-10 | Added `<WarningsAsErrors>FS0025</WarningsAsErrors>`. Build clean, 0 FS0025. Byte-identical by construction (severity-only flag, zero hits). |
| 2.1 build driver | `[x]` | byte-identical (0 diffs) | 11/11 builders migrated | ADR-0006 |
| 2.2 generic toUnified | `[x]` | 2026-06-10 | 2026-06-10 | Byte-identical (0 diffs vs umbrella tip). Added `UnifiedExtras`/`defaultExtras`/`arrayTags`/`splitTags` + generic `toUnified`; collapsed 8 trivial converters (posts, notes, snippets, wikis, ai-memex, presentations, album/playlist-collections). Kept responses family / books / albums / bookmarks explicit (divergence = documentation). |
| 2.3 view dedupe | `[x]` | 2026-06-11 | 2026-06-11 | Byte-identical (0 diffs). `postCardView (feedKey, withWebmention)` + 4 wrappers; `responseBodyView (style)` + `cleanResponseContent` folds 4 bodies (rsvp kept explicit); `layoutCore (includeReveal)` + `defaultLayout`/`defaultIndexedLayout` wrappers. SEO nosnippet comment corrected, markup unchanged. |
| 2.4 F7 slices | `[x]` slice (a); (b)→B2 | 2026-06-11 | 2026-06-11 | Byte-identical (0 diffs). `cleanCardHtml (html)` unifies all 4 timeline cleaning copies. Slice (b) STJ swap deferred into B2 (can't be byte-identical; B2 rewrites the path anyway). |
| 2.5 module splits | `[ ]` | — | — | |
| 2.6 nav data | `[ ]` | — | — | |
| 2.7 ContentType DU | `[ ]` | — | — | after 2.1/2.2 |
| 2.8 railway parse track | `[ ]` | — | — | after 2.1; F8 full fix |
| B1 registry | `[ ]` go/no-go pending | — | — | |
| B2 structured render | `[ ]` go/no-go pending | — | — | ADR-0007 |
| B3 Fable pilot | **NO-GO** (2026-06-10) | — | — | contract-gen adopted as optional item |
| B4 text-only unification | `[ ]` go/no-go pending | — | — | requires B2 |
