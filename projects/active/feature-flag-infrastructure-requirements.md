# Feature Flag Infrastructure Requirements

## Overview

**Feature Name**: Feature Flag Infrastructure for Content Migration  
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Small  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

## Problem Statement

### What Problem Are We Solving?
The new AST-based content processing infrastructure is complete, but we need a safe way to migrate content types from the existing string-based system without breaking the website. Currently, switching to new processors would be an all-or-nothing change with high risk of regressions.

### Who Is This For?
- **Developers**: Need safe migration tools for systematic content type transitions
- **Content Creators**: Require assurance that existing content will continue to work during migrations
- **Site Visitors**: Must experience zero downtime or broken functionality during migrations

### Why Now?
Feature flags are a prerequisite for all Phase 2 content migrations (snippets, wiki, presentations, etc.). Without this infrastructure, we cannot safely validate that new processors produce identical output to existing ones.

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Core Requirements)
- [ ] Environment variable controls for each content type (NEW_SNIPPETS, NEW_WIKI, etc.)
- [ ] Parallel execution of old and new processors without conflicts
- [ ] Output validation system that compares old vs new results
- [ ] Integration into existing build process (Program.fs) with minimal changes
- [ ] Clear error reporting when feature flags are misconfigured

### Should Have (Important Features)
- [ ] Migration progress tracking and reporting
- [ ] Automatic validation that both systems produce identical output
- [ ] Debug mode that shows which processor was used for each content type
- [ ] Documentation for content migration workflow

### Could Have (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Performance comparison between old and new processors
- [ ] Partial content migration (e.g., migrate only specific files for testing)
- [ ] Integration with test scripts for automated validation
- [ ] Migration rollback capabilities with single environment variable change

### Won't Have (Explicitly Out of Scope)
- [ ] Automatic migration scheduling or automation
- [ ] Content transformation during migration (handled by processors)
- [ ] UI for managing feature flags (command-line/environment only)
- [ ] Complex conditional logic beyond simple boolean flags

## User Stories

### Primary User Flow
**As a** developer migrating content types  
**I want** to enable new processors via environment variables  
**So that** I can safely test new functionality without breaking existing content

**As a** developer validating migrations  
**I want** to run both old and new processors and compare their output  
**So that** I can ensure identical results before switching permanently

### Edge Cases & Secondary Flows
- Feature flag set but new processor fails: fallback to old processor with warning
- Both old and new processors enabled: validation mode compares output
- Invalid content type in feature flag: clear error message
- Missing dependencies for new processor: graceful degradation

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview
Based on `docs/feature-flag-pattern.md` established in Phase 1D:

1. **Environment Variable Pattern**: NEW_[TYPE]=true controls processor selection
2. **Parallel Functions**: Keep existing functions alongside new implementations
3. **Conditional Execution**: Program.fs uses feature flags to choose processor
4. **Output Validation**: Compare old vs new results when both enabled

### Integration Points
- **Program.fs**: Main build orchestration with feature flag checks
- **Builder.fs**: Existing build functions remain unchanged
- **GenericBuilder.fs**: New processor implementations
- **Test Scripts**: Validation and comparison utilities

### Content Types for Migration
Based on backlog analysis:
- Snippets (pilot content type)
- Wiki pages
- Presentations
- Books/Library
- Blog posts
- Responses
- Albums

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Feature Flag System (Days 1-2)
- Environment variable parsing and validation
- Feature flag module with type-safe flags
- Integration into Program.fs build orchestration
- Basic error handling and reporting

### Phase 2: Output Validation System (Days 2-3)
- Output comparison utilities
- Validation reporting and metrics
- Integration with existing test scripts
- Debug and logging capabilities

### Phase 3: Migration Tools and Documentation (Days 3-5)
- Migration progress tracking
- Developer documentation and workflow guides
- Integration testing with snippets (pilot)
- Comprehensive validation scripts

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- ✅ Core Infrastructure Implementation (Phase 1A-1D complete)
- ✅ ASTParsing.fs, GenericBuilder.fs, CustomBlocks.fs modules
- ✅ Feature flag pattern documentation

### External Dependencies
- F# Environment module for variable access
- System.IO for file operations and output comparison
- Existing build process compatibility

## Risks and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Feature flags break existing build process
- **Mitigation**: Maintain backwards compatibility, default to existing behavior

- **Risk**: Performance impact from parallel processing
- **Mitigation**: Make validation mode optional, measure performance impact

### Process Risks
- **Risk**: Complex feature flag state management
- **Mitigation**: Simple boolean flags only, clear documentation

- **Risk**: Incomplete migration validation
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test scripts and automated comparison

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All success criteria implemented and tested
- [ ] Feature flags integrate seamlessly with existing build process
- [ ] Output validation confirms identical results between processors
- [ ] Developer documentation complete with migration workflow
- [ ] Test scripts validate all feature flag scenarios
- [ ] Ready for Phase 2 content migrations (starting with snippets)

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Integration
This infrastructure enables all Phase 2 content migrations with systematic validation and safe rollback capabilities.

### Performance Optimization
Future iterations could add performance monitoring and optimization based on real-world usage patterns.

### Automated Migration
Could evolve into automated migration tools that handle content type transitions systematically.
