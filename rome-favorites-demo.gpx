    <name>Colosseum</name>
    <desc>Ancient amphitheater and iconic symbol of Imperial Rome. Even with crowds, it's absolutely breathtaking.

Get here early to avoid crowds - first entry is much more magical. The underground tour is worth the extra cost.</desc>

    <name>Trattoria Monti</name>
    <desc>Family-run restaurant specializing in cuisine from Le Marche region. Absolutely incredible food and wine.

Ask Francesco about wine pairings - he has amazing knowledge. The carbonara here changed my life in 2019.</desc>

    <name>Gianicolo Hill</name>
    <desc>Best sunset spot in Rome with panoramic city views. Less touristy than other viewpoints.

Bring a beer from the shop below and watch the chaos of the city from above. Perfect for contemplation.</desc>

    <name>Sant'Eustachio Il Caff√®</name>
    <desc>Historic coffee roaster since 1938. Serves what many consider the best espresso in Rome.

Stand at the bar like locals do. Don't be intimidated by the crowds - the coffee is worth the wait.</desc>
