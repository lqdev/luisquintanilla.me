## 2025-07-08 - Core Infrastructure Implementation Phase 1A & 1B ✅

**Project**: [Core Infrastructure Implementation](projects/active/core-infrastructure.md)  
**Duration**: 2025-07-08 (1 day)  
**Status**: Phase 1A & 1B Complete

### What Changed
Implemented foundational infrastructure for systematic website architecture upgrade with AST-based parsing and extensible custom block system.

### Technical Improvements
- **AST-Based Parsing**: Replaced string manipulation with Markdig AST parsing in `ASTParsing.fs`
- **Custom Block System**: Implemented `:::media`, `:::review`, `:::venue`, `:::rsvp` block types with YAML parsing
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type definitions for MediaType, AspectRatio, Location, and custom blocks
- **Generic Content Processing**: `ContentProcessor<'T>` pattern for unified Post/Snippet/Wiki handling
- **Extensible Rendering**: Modular block renderers with IndieWeb microformat support
- **Build System**: All new modules compile alongside existing codebase without conflicts

### Features Added
- MediaTypes.fs: IndieWeb-compliant media type system
- CustomBlocks.fs: Custom markdown block parsing with Markdig extension
- BlockRenderers.fs: HTML rendering with h-card, h-entry microformat support
- GenericBuilder.fs: Unified content processing pipeline with feed generation
- ASTParsing.fs: Centralized AST parsing with robust error handling

### Architecture Impact
- Foundation established for replacing repetitive build functions with unified system
- Parallel development approach allows gradual migration without breaking existing functionality
- Extensible design enables easy addition of new content types and custom blocks
- Ready for Phase 1C domain enhancement and pipeline integration

### Documentation Created/Updated
- Phase-specific development logs (Phase 1A: logs/2025-07-08-phase1a-log.md, Phase 1B: logs/2025-07-08-phase1b-log.md)
- Comprehensive testing scripts (test-ast-parsing.fsx, test-phase1b.fsx)
- Updated project plan with completion status and validation results
