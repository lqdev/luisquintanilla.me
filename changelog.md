- **Build Integration**: Validated zero conflicts with existing build process during parallel development
- **Module Documentation**: Created complete architecture documentation for all new modules
- **Feature Flag Pattern**: Prepared migration strategy using environment variables for gradual content type transitions

### Features Added
- **Test Content Files**: `test-content/comprehensive-blocks-test.md` and `test-content/simple-review-test.md` for validation
- **Test Scripts**: Comparison, context validation, and integration test scripts in `test-scripts/` directory
- **Documentation**: `docs/core-infrastructure-architecture.md` and `docs/feature-flag-pattern.md`
- **Migration Readiness**: Environment variable pattern (NEW_[TYPE]=true) for Phase 2 content migrations

### Architecture Impact
- **Zero Regression**: All existing functionality preserved and working correctly
- **Parallel Development**: New AST-based system coexists safely with existing string-based processing
- **Migration Foundation**: Clear path forward for gradual content type migrations without breaking changes
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation ensures infrastructure reliability

### Documentation Created/Updated
- [Core Infrastructure Architecture](docs/core-infrastructure-architecture.md) - Complete module reference
- [Feature Flag Pattern](docs/feature-flag-pattern.md) - Phase 2 migration strategy
- [Project Plan Updates](projects/archive/core-infrastructure.md) - Phase completion status (archived)

**Phase 1 Infrastructure Status**: All 4 phases (1A-1D) complete. Foundation ready for Phase 2 content migrations.
