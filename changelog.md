- **Feed Location**: Feed moved from `/resources/library/feed.xml` → `/reviews/feed.xml` (content-proximate placement)
- **Feed Metadata**: Updated RSS feed title from "Library" to "Reviews" with appropriate description
- **Content Type Unification**: RSS items now use "reviews" content type instead of "library" in unified feeds
- **Architecture Cleanup**: Eliminated confusing dual terminology (library vs reviews)

### File Changes
- **GenericBuilder.fs**: Updated BookProcessor URLs, feed configuration, and content type references
- **Program.fs**: Changed unified feed mapping from "library" to "reviews"
- **Test Documentation**: Updated website navigation test plan to reflect consolidation

### Feed Architecture Impact
**Complete Feed Coverage**: All 8 active content types now have properly located feeds:
1. Posts → `/posts/feed.xml`
2. Notes → `/notes/feed.xml` 
3. Responses → `/responses/feed.xml`
4. Snippets → `/resources/snippets/feed.xml`
5. Wiki → `/resources/wiki/feed.xml`
6. Presentations → `/resources/presentations/feed.xml`
7. **Reviews** → `/reviews/feed.xml` ✅ **CONSOLIDATED**
8. Media → `/media/feed.xml`

### Architecture Benefits
- **Navigation Consistency**: Menu "Books" link (`/reviews`) now matches feed location
- **Content-Proximate Feeds**: Reviews feed follows established pattern of being located with content
- **Simplified Terminology**: Single "reviews" term replaces confusing library/reviews duality
- **User Experience**: Intuitive feed discovery at expected `/reviews/feed.xml` location

### Success Metrics
- **Feed Location**: Moved from non-intuitive `/resources/library/` to logical `/reviews/`
- **URL Consistency**: 100% alignment between navigation structure and content URLs
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved with improved architecture

**Duration**: Phase 1 Complete (0.5 days)  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Migration Strategy Corrected

### What Changed
Completed analysis of wiki system and discovered the actual state: wiki processing is broken/disabled, not missing entirely. Navigation links exist but no content is generated, requiring restoration and migration approach.

### Technical Discoveries  
- **Broken System Found**: Wiki processing functions missing from `Program.fs` but navigation expects them
- **Mixed Infrastructure**: Both old (`Services\Markdown.fs::parseWiki`) and new (`ASTParsing.fs::parseWikiFromFile`) parsers exist
- **Standard Migration Pattern**: Need to restore old system for baseline, then migrate using proven snippets pattern
- **Content Ready**: 26 wiki files with consistent metadata patterns ready for processing

### Architecture Impact
- **Restored Migration Approach**: Will use proven old/new parallel system with feature flags
- **Output Compatibility**: Can establish baseline by restoring old system first
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Both old and new parsing systems available for comparison
- **Standard Pattern**: Apply validated snippets migration approach to wiki content

### Documentation Created/Updated
- [Wiki Migration Requirements](projects/active/wiki-migration-requirements.md) 
- [Wiki Migration Project Plan](projects/active/wiki-migration.md) - Phase 1 complete, strategy corrected
- Phase 1 analysis corrected (user identified broken system vs missing system)

### Next Steps
Phase 2: Restore old wiki system for baseline, then implement new AST system with feature flags for safe migration.
