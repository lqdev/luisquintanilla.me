## Proposed Feature

Automate the process of creating playlist collection posts in `lqdev/luisquintanilla.me` using GitHub Issue Templates and GitHub Actions, leveraging the [`playlist-creator`](https://github.com/lqdev/playlist-creator) tool.

### Background
Currently, playlists are composed manually by running the playlist-creator program and copy-pasting generated content. The goal is to standardize and automate this workflow similar to other site collections (notes, media, reviews, etc.).

## Implementation Tasks
1. **Create new GitHub Issue Template:**  
   - Template form fields:
     - Playlist Title
     - Spotify playlist URL (required)
     - Optional: Custom text/commentary
     - Optional: Slug
     - Optional: Additional tags
   - Default tags should include: `playlist`, `music`, `spotify`, `youtube`, `cratefinds`
   - Location: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/post-playlist.yml`
2. **Develop GitHub Actions workflow:**
   - Set up a workflow to process new playlist issues by:
     - Installing project dependencies  with `uv` per `playlist-creator`'s requirements
     - Running the playlist-creator tool to generate the markdown track list
     - Combining form input and generated content into a properly formatted markdown post
     - Placing the new file in `_src/playlists/`
     - Creating a Pull Request (PR) for manual review (no auto-merge)
     - Closing the issue after PR creation
   - Location: `.github/workflows/process-playlist-issue.yml`
3. **Add new label to label sync config:**
   - Label: `playlist`, color: `1d76db`, description: "Playlist content creation and management"
   - Update label sync workflow/config if needed
4. **Documentation update:**
   - Add setup & troubleshooting instructions for playlist automation to project docs/README

## Dependencies
- Secrets required in repo: `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Update instructions to use `uv` per `playlist-creator` docs
- Use timezone format `-05:00` for post dates (consistent with other collections)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Submitting the playlist issue form creates a correctly formatted PR with a playlist markdown post
- [ ] Playlist markdown follows the style of existing samples (frontmatter, tags, commentary, track list, original Spotify link)
- [ ] Action uses `uv` for dependency install
- [ ] PR is not auto-merged (manual review required)
- [ ] Issues close automatically after PR creation
- [ ] Errors are surfaced in Action logs; no email/Slack notification required
