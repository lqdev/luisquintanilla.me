I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of the singles released before the album. Though I have to say, there's been a few times Era Primavera has been stuck in my head. Very catchy.

I haven't listened to the whole thing, but so far I really like the tracks Notebook Fantasy, Parallels, and Beautiful Daughter.
