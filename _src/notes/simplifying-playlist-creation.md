Just streamlined my [playlist](/collections/playlists/) generation by following the [GitHub Issues and Actions pattern](https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/blob/main/docs/github-issue-posting-guide.md) I've established for other post types. The content for those posts is generated using [playlist-creator](https://github.com/lqdev/playlist-creator), another project I built a while back.
