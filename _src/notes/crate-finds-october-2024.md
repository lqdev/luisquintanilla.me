Lots of music released this month

- [Chromakopia by Tyler The Creator](/responses/chromakopia-tyler-the-creator-released)
- [Spirit Box by Flying Lotus](/responses/spirit-box-flying-lotus)

Both amazing albums I've now listed to multiple times from beginning to end.

That said, the Crate Finds this month are light and can best be summarized as my favorite songs from [Got A Story to Tell by Thee Sacred Souls](/notes/got-a-story-to-tell-thee-sacred-souls).
