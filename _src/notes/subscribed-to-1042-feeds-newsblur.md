I use [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com/) as my feed reader. In it, I subscribe to:

- newsletters
- personal blogs
- sports blogs
- news publications
- GitHub releases
- Mastodon feeds and tags
- Bluesky feeds
- StackOverflow tags
- subreddits
- podcasts
- severe weather alerts
- YouTube channels
- PeerTube instances and channels
- Lemmy instances and sublemmys? (I don't know the Lemmy lingo yet)
- Forums

Basically, if it has an RSS feed, I subscribe to it there. 

Today I noticed I'm subscribed over 1000 feeds (1042 to be exact)!

Over 300 of them are personal blogs. This has taken a few years to curate. I remember my reader being empty when I first started. As I've read [newsletters and personal blogs](https://peopleandblogs.com/), I've followed things they've linked to which is where I find even more feeds to subscribe to, especially when [they're easy to find](https://rknight.me/blog/please-expose-your-rss/). 

There's some pruning that needs to happen at this point whether that's because of broken links or I just don't read those publications often. However, I find myself usually [checking in on personal blogs and newsletters on a daily basis](/notes/simplifying-feed-publishing-workflow) so I think many of those will stay.
