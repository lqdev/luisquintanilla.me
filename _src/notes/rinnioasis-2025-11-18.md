So cool to see there's an active community on Reddit ([r/innioasis](https://www.reddit.com/r/innioasis/)) for these devices. The [Y1](https://www.innioasis.com/products/y1), appears to be the most popular device which I got a little over a month ago. Really loving it so far especially when paired with the [Podcast TUI](/posts/introducing-podcast-tui/) app I vibe-coded.
