I finally decided to dust off my Discord. So far, I've joined several communities like:

- HuggingFace
- LangChain
- LlamaIndex
- Racket
- Virtual ML.NET
- Shudder
- ClubTwit
- ...and many others

I've noticed that server / community discovery needs improvement, so I'm asking for your recommendations!

General topics I'm interested in:

- AI
- Machine Learning
- Open Source
- Software Development
- .NET
- F#
- Open Web
- IndieWeb
- Fediverse
- Lisp
- Tech
- Personal Finance
- Podcasts
- Books
- Travel
- Retro Tech
- Retro Gaming

E-mail me your recommendations at contact@lqdev.me or send me a Webmention!

Thanks in advance.
