Based on the post, [own your RSS links](/responses/own-your-rss-links), I decided to set up redirects for all my RSS feeds which was very easy to do using Azure CDN. You can find the updated links in my [feed page](/feed). If you're currently subscribed to any of those feeds, you can keep using the old URLs but I'd recommend updating your feed reader with the latest URLs.
