It's finally here! 

I can't say I'm too surprised by the results.

Compared to last year, I nearly doubled my listening minutes. Also, none of the artists from the [previous year](/notes/spotify-wrapped-2023) made it onto this list. Although, I'm not sure how Buffalo Springfield worked its way into the list of top artists. 

I love how my listening habits from September are described, "Witchy Jam Band Psychedelic Rock".
