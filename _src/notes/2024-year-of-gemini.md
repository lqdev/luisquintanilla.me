If 2023 was the year of AI and the Fediverse, is 2024 the year of Gemini? 

I've been seeing a few posts about Gemini cross my feed reader which is more than I'm used to seeing. These include:

- [The Gopher Revival Is Upon Us](https://hackaday.com/2023/12/29/the-gopher-revival-is-upon-us/)
- [Poor Man's Web](https://zserge.com/posts/small-web/)

Gemini is weird in a fun way. 

Since content is text-based, using terminal clients like [Elpher](https://thelambdalab.xyz/elpher/) and [Amfora](https://github.com/makew0rld/amfora) make it easy to browse pages (capsules) and blogs (gemlogs).
