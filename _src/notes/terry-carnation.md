Can't believe I hadn't heard about these podcasts before:

- [Radio Rental](https://radiorentalusa.com/)
- [Dark Air](https://audioboom.com/channels/5046661)

Love the horror anthology vibes like Tales From The Crypt and Freakshow for Radio Rental. For Dark Air, I really like the Space Ghost Coast to Coast and actual Coast to Coast feel. Best of all, the host Terry Carnation is Rainn Wilson. Even [Terry's website](https://www.terrycarnation.com/) has a great 90's web feel to it. Looks like Dark Air has been off the air for some time, but hopefully Radio Rental keeps publishing content.
