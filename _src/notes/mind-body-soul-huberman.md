In the past two weeks I've been listening to a few episodes from the [Huberman Lab podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast). In many of the episodes, the host, Dr. Andrew Huberman, brings on guests to talk about topics like nutrition, fertility, motivation, finding your purpose, and many others. It's interesting though that despite the large diversity of topics and guests, at their core, many of the conversations ended up coming back to mind, body, and soul. More specifically, nurturing those various aspects of our lives. This includes but is not limited to, fueling your body with the right foods, building community, being active, learning new things, exposing yourself to new experiences, etc.
