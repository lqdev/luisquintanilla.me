Good thing I'd upgraded to 4.1.7 just a few weeks ago, so getting to 4.2.0 was relatively easy. The [wiki](/resources/wiki/mastodon-server-upgrades/) where I'm tracking updates makes it easy to quickly remember the general process. I haven't tried all of the new features, but it's nice to see there's a new onboarding flow to the Web UI which should make it easier to get started for new folks.
