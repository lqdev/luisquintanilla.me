Since I use custom markdown blocks for media posts, the raw markdown blocks were being rendered in Mastodon. That's now fixed and working as expected. Here's what that a media post (note with attachment) looks like.

I'm feeling really good about my implementation. I'll keep testing other post types but I'm feeling confident about deprovisioning my instance and moving entirely to my website soon.
