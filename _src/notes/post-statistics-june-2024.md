6 months in and these are the main takeaways.

- At 51 notes, I'm 10 over last year's total notes. 
- Responses are healthy. I'm closing in on 200. I wasn't as active the month of May so I'm still shy of last year's mark, but given it's still only halfway through the year, it seems like good progress so far. 
- Most of my posts continue to be related to AI. While I can believe it, I also think I could be more specific and get more creative with my tags. Given the lead AI has though in terms of tag numbers, it'll be harder for those more fine-grained tags to come through. 
- I won't use the word struggle, but I have paid less attention to long form posts. There's a few that I have planned for June, so that should help bump those numbers.  

Overall I'm happy with the progress and use I'm getting out of the website. 

Some things I'd like to work on are simplifying my authoring process. Although github.dev and Codespaces can be convenient, it's a hassle. Authoring content locally reduces some of that friction. However, I'm still bound to my laptop. 

As a Day One subscriber, I haven't maximized my subscription. This past week I've started to use it more for bookmarking articles I'm reading. Maybe that's a way that I can bookmark articles when on the go and when I'm ready to reshare them on the website, I can just copy from there. 

Something else I can use Day One for are to start longer form blog or note drafts. Then, when I'm ready to do more serious work and publish them, I can continue on my laptop.
