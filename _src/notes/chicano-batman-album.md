I find it amazing how you could've heard a song before but on rare occasions, you actually get to really listen to the song. That's been happening to me with this album from Chicano Batman. I've written before about how much I enjoy A Hundred Dead and Loving Souls. Lately though, I've been really into Itotiani, La Samoana, and Soniatl. The instrumentals are amazing. Wild to think this album is now 15 years old.
