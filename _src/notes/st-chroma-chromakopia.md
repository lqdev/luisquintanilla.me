I love the album overall but St. Chroma is a great intro that sets up the rest of the album. 

Some of my favorite parts from the track

> You are the light. It's not on you, it's in you. Don't you ever in your motherfucking life dim your light for nobody.

> P said I could do it too, and boy, did I believe him. I built a path to freedom 'cause them words that he said. Give a fuck about tradition, stop impressin' the dead

> Don't you ever stop bein' who you are and dimmin' your light for none of these motherfuckers out here
