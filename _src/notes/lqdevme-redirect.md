That was easier than I thought. Visiting [lqdev.me](http://lqdev.me) now redirects to this site. Redirect isn't limited to the main page though. You can also access any other resources as well. For example, visiting [lqdev.me/feed](http://lqdev.me/feed) would redirect you to the main feed on this site.
