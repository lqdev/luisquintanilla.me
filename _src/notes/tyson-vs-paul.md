Amazing that Tyson at his age just did that. He earned that paycheck. That said, it was tough to watch and fortunately it didn't seem like he got hurt too bad. It looked like Jake was pulling his punches because that fight could've ended in the 2nd / 3rd round. Overall, it's the best outcome possible. Jake can say he "beat" Mike Tyson, Tyson didn't get knocked out or hurt too bad, and they both earned a decent paycheck.
