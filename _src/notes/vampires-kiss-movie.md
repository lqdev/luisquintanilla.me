[![Vampire's Kiss Movie Trailer](http://img.youtube.com/vi/PnoSxO_2ghQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnoSxO_2ghQ "Vampire's Kiss Movie Trailer")

I have no idea what I just watched, but I liked it. I thought Nicolas Cage making weird movies was a relatively recent thing, but I guess it goes way back to the 80s. I kept getting thrown off by his accent, which I only noticed about a quarter into the movie and even later into the movie sometimes it wasn't there. His descent and transformation into "Nosferatu" was interesting to watch. Mostly funny, but sometimes just weird and disturbing. 

If you're interested, it's currently [streaming for free on Tubi](https://tubitv.com/movies/674418/vampire-s-kiss)
