In my recent post, [Using Generative AI to produce Spotify Clips](/posts/generative-ai-spotify-clips) I listed a bunch of challenges but realized I missed a big one. While listening to [IJ by Sam Gendel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0CqHxDG74k), I realized, what do you do about instrumental songs, solos, or songs with few lyrics? 

Some sort of audio-to-video technique? 

Maybe using metadata like title, genre, beats-per-minute (BPM), spectrogram, and musical notes would work? 

Or generating an image and animating it or its background to add depth similar to how in the [VideoPoet blog post](https://blog.research.google/2023/12/videopoet-large-language-model-for-zero.html), the image of the Mona Lisa is animated. 

It would be a fun experiment.
