I can't believe it's been almost two years since I posted about the [announcement of the Snapdragon X Elite chips](/notes/snapdragon-summit-2023-addendum).

I had a chance to catch their latest [announcement of the X2 Elite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpHCkdIg9gU)

So many exciting improvements. The part of the talk that caught my attention the most was [Steve Bathiche talking about PC form factors](https://www.youtube.com/live/fpHCkdIg9gU?si=KnoxYc8bIiIKMVV1&t=3768). Specifically, the idea that the next computer is not a device, but a computing substrate with you at the center. 

That sounds exciting, but in that world, more than ever, we need to have complete ownership and control over our devices and data. 

I drafted a post about a month ago that I never published. I cleaned it up and hit publish. 

Turns out, two years later, I'm still asking for the same thing. [I want a mobile computer](/posts/i-want-mobile-computer).
