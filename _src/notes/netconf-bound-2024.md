It's that time of the year again. A new .NET release.

Tons of great sessions at .NET Conf this year, which you can see in the [agenda](https://www.dotnetconf.net/).

I'll be taking part in two sessions:

- Building AI Applications from Scratch: A Hands-On Guide for .NET Developers
- Building the Foundation: AI Fundamentals in .NET
