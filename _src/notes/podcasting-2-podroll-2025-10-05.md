I just learned about the [Podroll](https://podcasting2.org/docs/podcast-namespace/tags/podroll) tag while listening to one of the latest episodes of [Podcasting 2.0](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/920666).

The documentation describes it as:

> This element allows for a podcaster to include references to one or more podcasts in its `<channel>` as a way of "recommending" other podcasts to their listener. It's normally shown in user interfaces as "creator recommendations", or "shows you might like".

Independently, I created something similar for this exact purpose a few years back which I also called [Podroll](/podroll).

One improvement that would be nice for them to add is support for providing a collection URL rather than listing feeds individually.

This would serve three purposes:

1. **Unified recommendations** - A single link for all your recommendations
2. **Organized collections** - Create multiple podrolls organized by different criteria or topics, similar to ["starter packs"](/collections/starter-packs/)
3. **Simplified linking** - Link to multiple podrolls through a single collection URL, giving users access to all the feeds within
