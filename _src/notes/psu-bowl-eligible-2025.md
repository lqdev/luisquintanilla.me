Penn State is bowl eligible! Amazing game that came down to the wire. In the end, the defense pulled off the win. Regardless of what happens with the coaching situation, I'm so happy for Terry Smith. If the bowl game is his last as head coach, he's already done so much for the program and deserves nothing but praise given the mess he was left to clean up.
