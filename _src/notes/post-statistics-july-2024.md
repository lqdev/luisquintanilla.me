Better late than never. 

Nothing too interesting this month. I haven't been posting as much. 

I think part of that is because I've been creating DayOne posts more. 

I've been relying on DayOne to share articles from my RSS reader. That's worked really well for bookmarking. 

As far as my authoring process, when working locally, I've been using Emacs more. 

One reason for Emacs is [capture templates](https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/tree/main/.templates). 

Technically, I already have something similar with [VS Code Snippets](https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/tree/main/.vscode).

I like the richness of the Emacs experience more though. 

The future workflow I'm thinking of involves two components:

- Elfeed
- Nyxt

When reading articles using Elfeed, I can create a function that takes the information from the entry I'm on and converts it into an entry on my site using capture templates.

Similarly, in Nyxt while browsing the internet, I can create a similar function which uses capture templates to create website entries. 

Maybe I can get a long-form post out of that experiment. 

As far as numbers go, I'm at 56 notes for the year which is 15 more than last year.

I'm closing in on passing last year's response count at 210. 

Most of the content shared continues to be mainly about AI.

Top linked domain is still The Verge.
