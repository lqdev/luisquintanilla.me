While making some updates to my X profile, I noticed the link displayed on my bio isn't the same one I configured in the form. Instead it's a t.co shortened link. I get I'm just a free user on the platform but that seems like an annoying change. I haven't found much details about the change, but I'd hope paying subscribers get the "perk" of having control over how the link on their bio displays.
