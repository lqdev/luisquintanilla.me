It's been a while since I've done one of these. 

One thing I'm changing is the titles. For the other posts, the titles don't match up with the date for the metrics. For example the post for "July 2024" was actually talking about June metrics. Kind of confusing, so fixing that this month. 

This is my post 

| Post Type | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Blogs | 4 |
| Notes | 83 |
| Responses | 251 |

Overall the trend is nice. I'm just under 1 response a day. Not like that's the goal, but in general I think it shows a steady stream of content I'm posting on the website.  

With two recent blog posts published, that brings me to 5. The script ran just before I hit publish on the last blog which is why you only see four.

- [Digitize Analog Bookmarks using AI, .NET, and GitHub Models](/posts/digitize-analog-bookmarks-with-ai-dotnet/)

There's a few other ideas I'm tinkering with, which might easily get me close to or past the 8 blog posts from last year.
