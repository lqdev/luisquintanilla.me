New drop from FlyLo. This feels like a new album coming. So far the theme is mystical. 

The previous single, [Garmonbozia](/responses/new-flying-lotus-garmonbozia), was a reference to Twin Peaks. 

Ingo Swann's website describes him as

> ...a pioneer of parapsychology and remote viewing, who worked with CIA and NASA, wrote books, and created art. 

The website invites visitors to, 

> explore his research on NHEs, UFOs, UAPs, and the planets.

Similarly, Wikipedia describes him as 

> an American psychic, artist, and author, whose claims of clairvoyance were investigated as a part of the Central Intelligence Agency’s Stargate Project. Swann is credited as the creator of the term “Remote Viewing," a term which refers to the use of extrasensory perception to perceive distant persons, places, or events.

I'm excited to discovery the mystery behind this new project from FlyLo.
