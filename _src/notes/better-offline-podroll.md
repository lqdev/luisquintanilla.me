While doing chores today, I put on one of the episodes from [Ed Zitron's](https://www.wheresyoured.at/about/) [Better Offline podcast](https://www.betteroffline.com/). This resulted me in me basically binging the rest of the episodes on the backlog. Also, it's now made its way into the regular rotation with other podcasts and the [podroll](/collections/podroll/).
