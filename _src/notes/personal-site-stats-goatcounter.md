I've been looking at different alternatives to Google Analytics for website stats. I don't need anything fancy, just basic page counts. Eventually I settled on [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) because it's lightweight, open-source, and privacy-friendly. You can either use their managed service or self-host. Deployment with Docker felt a bit much so I did a standalone deployment to a VM. The Linode StackScript is probably the easiest way to do it.
