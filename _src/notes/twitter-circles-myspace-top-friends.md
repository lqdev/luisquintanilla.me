Twitter is testing a new feature called [Twitter Circles](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/3/23055515/twitter-circle-close-friends-private-tweets-150-people) where you can restrict the reach of your tweets to up to 150 people. I remember the days of MySpace where many relationships were made / broken as a result of being in someone's Top 8 Friends list <span>&#x1F606;</span>
