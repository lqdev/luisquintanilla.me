I've written before about how [versatile the RSS protocol is for publishing and consuming content](/posts/rediscovering-rss-user-freedom/). Podcasts are one of the many media types that largely rely on RSS, making it easy to subscribe and manage using an RSS client of your choice. Like RSS, [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) is versatile in the type of media it can play. When you combine the two, you're able to stay updated on the latest episodes from your favorite podcasts using the RSS reader of your choice and use the episode's URL to stream the audio in VLC.
