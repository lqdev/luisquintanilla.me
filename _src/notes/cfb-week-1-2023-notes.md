College football is back!

Penn State had a great win. Looking back at a [post from last year](/notes/psu-future-allar), some of my thoughts around the upcoming class were right. Looking at the upcoming schedule it looks well spaced out and if they can stay healthy, they'll have a great season.

Tough losses for LSU and Clemson. 

This year I'm trying a new way to experience games: blogs + audio streams.

This past week, although I tuned into the games, I didn't watch any of them on TV. Instead, I tuned into the live audio streams on [The Varsity Network](https://thevarsitynetwork.com/feed) and for live discusson, I tuned into the various team blogs / communities provided by [SBNation](https://www.sbnation.com/) (fun fact: I learned SB stands for Sports Blogs). For example, [Black Shoe Diaries](https://www.blackshoediaries.com/), the Penn State blog, had a [live thread](https://www.blackshoediaries.com/2023/9/2/23855867/penn-state-nittany-lions-football-west-virginia-fourth-quarter-open-thread-bsd) for each of the quarters where site writers and fans got to interact in real-time. Other team blogs had similar threads. 

Overall, I thought it was a fun experience, and I'm most likely going to do it again this week. 

Games I'm most looking forward to Week 2:

- Stanford vs USC
- Temple vs Rutgers
- Texas vs Alabama
