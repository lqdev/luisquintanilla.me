I didn't know Martin Lawrence was still making movies. I knew about Bad Boys but that was almost 4 years ago. Just watched [Mindcage](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mindcage), one of his latest ones. It was alright. The story is similar to Silence of the Lambs. Detectives seeking help from a manipulative serial killer to catch another killer on the loose. The twist at the end was interesting and not what I was expecting.
