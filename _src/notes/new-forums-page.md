Following the patterns of a blogroll and podroll, I decided to post a [forums page](/collections/forums/) to list various forums and communities I find interesting.

I've also created an [OPML file](/collections/forums//index.opml) for it so you can subscribe to them in your RSS reader of choice. 

Discord is good for communities. For example on servers like Shudder there's watch parties and HuggingFace reading club gets together to discuss some of the latest papers. For events, this works really well because everyone can participate in real-time. However, I find that outside of events or general chat, it's difficult to follow the message stream. I like the forum format with topics / threads much better. 

If you have any forum recommendations, feel free to [send them my way](/contact).
