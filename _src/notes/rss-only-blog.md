I stumbled upon [theunderground blog](https://theunderground.blog/) by [Chris McLeod](https://chrismcleod.dev/) which is an interesting twist on [RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/). Currently theunderground has a page that serves as the homepage and the RSS feed itself. I wonder whether it's possible to take it even further by using XSL(T) to style the RSS feed as shown in this [Style Your RSS Feed](https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/) post by [Darek Kay](https://darekkay.com/blog/rss-styling/). By styling the RSS feed, it can serve as the homepage as well. Using redirection, when people land on your domain, they would instead be presented with the styled RSS feed.
