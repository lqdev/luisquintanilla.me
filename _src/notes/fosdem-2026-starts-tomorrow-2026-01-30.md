I almost forgot tomorrow is the start of FOSDEM. 

There's so many good sessions. I already added talks from the following tracks to my calendar:

- [AI Plumblers](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/ai/)
- [Collaboration and content management](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/collaboration-and-content-management/)
- [Decentralized Communication](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/decentralised-communication/)
- [Decentralized Internet and Privacy](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/decentralized-internet-and-privacy/)
- [Social Web](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/social-web/)

I know I won't get to all of them, but I'm planning on being at [Maho's](https://maho.dev/) [Decentralised Badges with BadgeFed: Implementing ActivityPub-based Credentials for Non Profits](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/JEMNBZ-decentralised-badges-activitypub-badgefed/) talk. 

[POSSE content with Drupal using Nostr](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/SDDNPS-posse-content-drupal-nostr/) by [Sebastian Hagens](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/speaker/sebastian_hagens/) looks very interesting as well. Mainly because I'm thinking of doing something similar for my site.
