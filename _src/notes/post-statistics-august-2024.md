Finished July with more regular posting. 

Only 4 posts away from passing last year's response count.

As mentioned on [another post](/notes/org-capture-functions-file-target), I've been slowly working on transitioning authoring workflows to Emacs using org-capture templates.

This month, I want to work on making capturing content from Nyxt more seamless, especially since responses are the types of posts I use most. 

The other thing I'd like to start doing is consolidating the structure of my posts. Right now the YAML front-matter for the various posts types is significantly different. However, it doesn't have to be. 

For most posts, I need:

- Title
- Date published
- Data updated
- Tags

Responses are a little different because I also need to include the link to the original content I'm referencing in the post. 

Once that's done, at some point, I'd also like to consolidate my URLs. 

- `/posts` captures long-form blog posts
- `/feed` captures microblog posts and responses

Since everything is a post, consolidating under one of them for all my posts and providing additional urls like `/notes`, `/photos`, `/articles` for the individual types of posts might make more sense.
