Today I Learned about the [VS Code Live Preview extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server). While reading the [release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71) for the latest version of VS Code, I noticed a [note](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_71#_live-preview) on the Live Preview extension. Usually to preview static content, I use Python's HTTP server with the `python -m http.server` command. This extension simplifies the process because it's built into Visual Studio Code. If you do any kind of web development, it's definitely worth a look.
