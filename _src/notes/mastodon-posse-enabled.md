Hello Mastodon from lqdev.me. Got [POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere)](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) working for Mastodon! I already had an Azure Logic App which took the latest post from my RSS feed and published to Twitter. Now it's also enabled for Mastodon. Might do a writeup later in the blog on how to do it.
