I have almost zero artistic skills, so when I came across [NVIDIA Canvas](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/canvas/) I was extremely excited!

Essentially it's an application that takes simple brushstrokes as input and uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to turn them into realistic landscape photos.

I had known about GANs being used to generate faces (see [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)) but it's one of the first times I've seen them used to enhance drawings. 

Time to take my stick figures to the next level!
