This gives me [Sidekick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_Hiptop) / [Sony Mylo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mylo_(Sony)) vibes. The only reason I wouldn't get it is battery life. I don't care for the gaming capabilities. 

Throw in an ARM-based processor like the Snapdragon X Elite for all-day battery life, give me USB-C ports to attach a dongle to, and I'm sold.
