# Starter Packs

Welcome to my curated collection of RSS Starter Packs.

Inspired by [BlueSky's Starter Pack feature](https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs), I've created a set of OPML bundles to help you discover and follow content across the open web. Whether it's a newsletter, blog, podcast, YouTube channel, Fediverse instance, or BlueSky profileâ€”if it has an RSS feed and aligns with the topic, it's included.

By leveraging open standards like RSS and OPML, my goal is to:

- Make it easy and convenient for others to discover, explore, and subscribe to content using their own feed readers
- Promote the open web and open standards. When building on open standards, it doesn't matter what platform or software you use. [Both publishers and subscribers have the freedom to choose](/posts/rediscovering-rss-user-freedom).
