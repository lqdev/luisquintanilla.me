## Review

Really fun read. I was able to binge the audiobook in 2 days which is rare for me. While I wouldn't say the general themes covered are original, it still made for a good story. The general book is a cross-over between Blade Runner, Silence of the Lambs, Ready Player One, and House of Cards. I liked the conversations and topics broughout up throughout the book such as:

- What is real?
- The value of privacy and anonimity
- Identity (who / what are you)?

Again, questions that stories like the ones mentioned earlier explore as well. I liked how Tim presented both sides of the argument with scenarios in which characters were presented with situations where they had to consider and sympathize with viewpoints that challenged their stance.
