## Review

Good book on how user control has been eroding over time resulting in walled gardens and large corporations with monopolistic tendencies. The first parts explore how we got here as well as lay out how adversarial interop may be a solution out of it. The last sections present and break down arguments against interoperability. Overall though it's a team sport that will take users and their representatives working together to take back user soverignty.
