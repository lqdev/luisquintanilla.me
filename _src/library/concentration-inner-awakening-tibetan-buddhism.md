## Description

> The practice of concentration is essential so that each of us can freely build our destiny. It allows us to get out of confusion and helps us to better control ourselves. Concentration exercises in daily life facilitate the development of our ability to overcome obstacles without repression or violence in order to obtain a more harmonious daily life. Concentration promotes the reappropriation of our memory and the rediscovery of our true identity.  
> <br>
> This little book invites us to discover in a simple way the itinerary of our consciousness according to the oral teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. This was the goal of the Lama Blo-bzang Don-yod when, in the 17th century to facilitate the learning of his disciples, he made a drawing representing the story of a character accompanied by three symbolic animals on a path.  
> <br>
> This path shows us the difficulties that we must overcome through simple and accessible mental and physical practices that demand very little of our daily time. Indeed, the key to this method is to permanently do a short practice daily rather than long occasional workshops.  

## Review

The book mainly concerns itself with the interpretation of a drawing inspired by an engraving done by Blo-Bzang Don-yod. While the drawing is packed with meaning and ideas, the book felt repetitive and dragged on in some parts. Although it's not a long or hard read at ~50 pages, it feels like it could've been condensed even further into less than 20 pages.
