## Quotes

> ...the value of physical capital in the US-land,machinery, and buildings for example-is about $10 trillion, but that value is dwarfed by the total value of *human* capital, which is estimated to be five to ten times larger. Human capital includes "the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans-their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition (p. 15/202)

> Instantaneous access to the world's knowledge through the Internet was supposed to educate and inform us, but instead it has created a society-wide poverty of attention (p. 18/202)

> Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking (p. 20/202)

> Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solutude before sharing it with others. (p. 21/202)

> A note is a "knowledge building block" - a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head. (p. 22/202)

> ..."heavy lift"-demanding instantaneous results from our brains without the benefit of a support system (p. 32/202)

> ..."slow burn"-allowing bits of thought matter to slowly simmer like a delicious pot of stew brewing on the stove. It is a calmer, more sustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas, instead of all-out binges of manic hustle (p. 32/202)

> When you feel stuck in your creative pursuits, it doesn't mean that theres's something wrong with you. You haven't lost your touch or run out of creative juice. It just means you don't yet have enough raw material to work with. If it feels like the well of inspiration has run dry, it's because you need a deeper well full of examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes-anything that will help you argue your perspective or fight for a cause you believe in (p. 34/202)

> ...*keep only what resonates* in a trusted place that you control, and...leave the rest aside. (p. 39/202)

> The best way to organize your notes is to *organize for action*, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, "How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?" (p. 39/202)

> Information becomes *knowledge*-personal,embodied,verified-only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it's just a theory. (p. 41/202)

> Think of yourself not just as a *taker* of notes, but as a *giver* of notes-you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand. (p.41/202)

> ...personal knowledge management exists to support taking action-anything else is a distraction. (p. 41/202)

> A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the information stream and curate only the best iedas we encouter in a private, trusted place. Think of it as plantnig your own "knowledge garden" where you are free to cultivate your ideas and develop your own thinking away from the deafening noise of other people's opinions. (p. 45/202)

> Feynman revealed his strategy...: *You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"* (p. 51/202)

> Thinking doesn't just produce writing; writing also enriches thinking (p. 62/202)

> Capture isn't about doing more. It's about taking notes on the experiences you're already having (p. 63/202)

> Your Second Brain isn't just a tool-it's an environment. It is a garden of knowledge full of familiar, winding pathways, but also secret and secluded corners. Every pathway is a jumping-off point to new ideas and perspectives. Gardens are natural, but they won't happen by accident. They require a caretaker to seed the plants, trim the weeds, and shape the paths winding through them. (p. 68/202)

> Knowledge is best applied through execution, which means whatever doesn't help you make progress on your projects is probably detracting from them (p. 78/202)

> Instead of organizing ideas according to *where the come from*...[organize] them according to *where they are going*-specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize. (p. 79/202)

> "move quickly and touch lightly"...look for the path of least resistance and make progress in short steps. (p. 83/202)

> "What is the smallest, easiest step I can take that moves me in the right direction?" (p. 83/202)

> If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it *emerges* from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences. (p. 107/202)

> ...Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know. It is about expressing your ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks to test what works and gather feedback from others. That feedback in turn gets drawn in to your Second Brain, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of your work. (p. 108/202) 

> Instead of thinking of your job in terms of *tasks*, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of *assets* and *building blocks* that you can assemble. (p. 122/202)

> To truly "know" something, it's not enough to read about it in a book. Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action. Thoughts are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To tryly make an idea stick, you have to engage with it. (p. 123/202)

> Postponing our goals and desires to "later" often ends up depriving us of the very experiences we need to grow. (p. 136/202)

> Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time. (p. 137/202)

## Notes

- (p. 17/202) Quantified Self community - A network of local meetup groups in which people share their stories about how they track their helth, productivity, mood, or behavior to learn more about themselves. 

- (p. 29/202) Memex (Scholar workstation) - A device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory (Vannevar Bush) 

- (p. 30/202) Four essential capabilities of Second Brain:
  - Making our ideas concrete.
  - Revealing new associations between ideas.
  - Incubating ideas over time
  - Sharpgning unique perspectives 

- (p. 36/202) Three stages of progress:
  - Remembering
  - Connecting
  - Creating

- (p. 37/202) CODE Method:
  - Capture: Keep what resonates
  - Organize: Save for actionability
  - Distill: Find the essence
  - Express: Show your work

- (p. 49/202) Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you're already doing and the life you're already living. 

- (p. 49/202) A knowledge aset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience. Examples include:
  - Highlights: Passages from books / articles your read.
  - Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts / audiobooks you listen to.
  - Bookmarks / Favorites: Links to content you find on the web or social media.
  - Voice Memos: Clips of recorded "notes to self"
  - Meeting Notes: Notes taken during meetings / calls.
  - Images: Photos or images you find interesting / inspiring.
  - Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, presentations you attended.

- (p. 55/202) Curator's Perspective - We are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives. This means taking charge of your own information stream. The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self spends organizing, distilling, and experessing.

- (p. 55/202) Capture criteria
  - Does it inspire me?
  - Is it useful?
  - Is it personal?
  - Is it surprising? By saving ideas that may contradict each other and don't necessarily support what we already believe, we can train ourselves to take in information from different sources instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. By playing with ideas-bending, stretching, and remixing them-we become less attached to the way they were originally presented and we can borrow certain aspects or elements to use in our own work. 

- (p. 57/202) Metadata capture. It's a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note, such as the original web page address, the title of the piece, the author or publisher, and the date it was published. Also, it's helpful to capture chapter titles, headings, and bullet-point lists, since they add structure to your notes and represent distillation already performed by the author on your behalf.  

- (p. 62/202) Generation Effect - According to research, when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words. 

- (p. 68/202) Cathedral Effect - According to studies, the environment we find ourselves in shapes our thinking. In a space with high ceilings (like a cathedral), we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we're in a room with low ceiling (like a small workshop), we're more likely to think concretely. 

- (p. 70/202) Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives (PARA)
  - Organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.

- (p. 77/202) ...separate capture and organize into two distinct steps. "Keeping what resonates" in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term. Most notes app have an "inbox" or "daily notes" section where new notes you've captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide whether they belong. 

- (p. 77/202) PARA's four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the decision of where to put your notes as easy as possible:
  - Projects are most actionable because you're working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind.
    - Complete webpage design
    - Create slide deck for conference
    - Plan vacation
    - Find new volunteer opportunity
    - Publish blog post
    - Complete online course
  - Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.
    - Activities or places you are responsible for: Home, Travel
    - People you are responsible for or accountable to: Friends, Spouse
    - Standards of performance you are responsible for: Health, Finances
    - Departments of functions you are responsible for: Marketing, Product Development
    - People or teams you are responsinble for or accountable to: Direct Reports, Manager
    - Standards of performance you are responsible for: Professional development, Relationshipts and networking
  - Resources may become actionable depending on the situation
    - Topics of interest: Beer brewing, architecture
    - Research subjects: Notetaking, Project management, Nutrition
    - Useful reference information: Vacation itineraries, Stock photos, product testimonials
    - Hobbies or passions: Coffee, Classic movies
  - Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.
    - Projects that are completed or cancelled
    - Areas of responsibility you're no longer commited to maintaining
    - Resources that are no longer relevant 

- (p. 78/202) PARA Checklist:
  - In which project will this be most useful?
  - If none: In which area will this be most useful?
  - If none: Which resource does this belong to?
  - If none: Place in archives.

- (p. 109/202) Intermediate Packets - Concrete individual building blocks that make up your work:
  - Set of notes from a team meeting
  - List of relevant research findings
  - Brainstorm with collaborators
  - Slide deck analyzing the market
  - List of action items from a conference call.

- (p. 110/202) Kinds of Intermediate Packets:
  - Distilled Notes - Books / articles you've read and distilled to their essence.
  - Outtakes - Material / ideas that didn't make it into a past project but could be used in future ones. 
  - Work-in-process - Documents, graphics, agendas, plans you produced during a past project
  - Final deliverables - Concrete pieces of work you've delivered as part of past projects. 
  - Documents created by others - knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work. 

- (p. 111/202) Benefits of Intermediate Packets:
  - Become interruption proof because you're focusing only on one small packet at a time.
  - Make progress in any time-span. No need for long uninterrupted time. 
  - Increase quality of your work by collecting feedback more often. 
  - Eventually you'll have so many intermediate packets at your disposal you can execute entire projects by just assembling previously created intermediate packets.

- (p. 104/202) Four retrieval methods:
  - Search: Most useful when you more or less know what you're looking for. 
  - Browsing
  - Tags: Labels that make it easier to see cross-disciplinaery themes and patterns beyond simple categorization.
  - Serendipity

- (p. 130/202) Divergence & Convergence:
  - Divergence - Gathering seeds of imagination and storing them in a secure place
    - Capture
    - Organize
  - Convergence - Shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks assembled
    - Distill
    - Express

- (p.131/202) Strategies for overcoming convergence pitfalls:
  - Give yourself stepping stones (Archipelago of ideas) - Gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. 
    - Reinvention of the old idea of outlining
    - Laying out the points you want to include up front
    - Advantages of digital outlines:
      - More malleable and flexible
      - Can include links to more detailed content
      - Can be Interactive and include multimedia
      - Searchable
      - Accessed and edited from anywhere 
  - Use yesterday's momentum today (Hemmingway Bridge) - End work sessions by establishing starting points for next session.
    - Write down ideas for next steps
    - Write down current status
    - Write down any details you have in mind that are likely forgotten once you step away
    - Write out your intention for the next work session 
    - Send your draft for feedback.
  - Ship something small and concrete (Dial down the scope) -
