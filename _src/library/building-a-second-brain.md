## Highlights

> ...the value of physical capital in the US-land,machinery, and buildings for example-is about $10 trillion, but that value is dwarfed by the total value of *human* capital, whic is estimated to be five to ten times larger. Human capital includes "the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans-their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition (p. 15/202)

> Instantaneous access to the world's knowledge through the Internet was supposed to educate and inform us, but instead it has created a society-wide poverty of attention (p. 18/202)

> Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking (p. 20/202)

> Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solutude before sharing it with others. (p. 21/202)

> A note is a "knowledge building block" - a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head. (p. 22/202)
