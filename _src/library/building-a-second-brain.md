## Highlights

> ...the value of physical capital in the US-land,machinery, and buildings for example-is about $10 trillion, but that value is dwarfed by the total value of *human* capital, whic is estimated to be five to ten times larger. Human capital includes "the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans-their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition (p. 15/202)

> Instantaneous access to the world's knowledge through the Internet was supposed to educate and inform us, but instead it has created a society-wide poverty of attention (p. 18/202)

> Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking (p. 20/202)

> Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solutude before sharing it with others. (p. 21/202)

> A note is a "knowledge building block" - a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head. (p. 22/202)

> ..."heavy lift"-demanding instantaneous results from our brains without the benefit of a support system (p. 32/202)

> ..."slow burn"-allowing bits of thought matter to slowly simmer like a delicious pot of stew brewing on the stove. It is a calmer, more sustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas, instead of all-out binges of manic hustle (p. 32/202)

> When you feel stuck in your creative pursuits, it doesn't mean that theres's something wrong with you. You haven't lost your touch or run out of creative juice. It just means you don't yet have enough raw material to work with. If it feels like the well of inspiration has run dry, it's because you need a deeper well full of examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes-anything that will help you argue your perspective or fight for a cause you believe in (p. 34/202)

> ...*keep only what resonates* in a trusted place that you control, and...leave the rest aside. (p. 39/202)

> The best way to organize your notes is to *organize for action*, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, "How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?" (p. 39/202)

> Information becomes *knowledge*-personal,embodied,verified-only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it's just a theory. (p. 41/202)

> Think of yourself not just as a *taker* of notes, but as a *giver* of notes-you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand. (p.41/202)

> ...personal knowledge management exists to support taking action-anything else is a distraction. (p. 41/202)
