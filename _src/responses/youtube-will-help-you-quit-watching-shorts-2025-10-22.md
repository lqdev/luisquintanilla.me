> YouTube has added a new Shorts feature that makes it easier to manage how much time youâ€™re spending watching videos. Mobile users can now set a customizable daily limit that restricts how long they can scroll Shorts feeds, aiming to help viewers better manage their time instead of endlessly scrolling.

I gotta admit this is a useful feature. At the same time, WHAT?!

Selling the problem and the solution.
