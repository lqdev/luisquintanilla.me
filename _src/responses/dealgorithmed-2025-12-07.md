> Dealgorithmed is a newsletter for the people who still love and care about the web, for those who are tired of doomscrolling the same three sites day after day.  
> <br>
> A newsletter about the small web, the poetic web, the quiet web, the web many say we lost years ago, yet it's still here, ready to be rediscovered by those who care.

Subscribed! Really looking forward to this newsletter from [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/). If you're interested in more of his work, I recommend reading through the [People & Blogs](https://peopleandblogs.com/) catalog.
