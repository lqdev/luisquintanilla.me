> This is just a place for me to share. I been wanting a lil blog for years. Somewhere to post random shit I fuck with where the audience is way smaller than it is on the social media platforms. Finally pulled the trigger, bare with us as we still developing this page and the layout.

This is cool! 

I ran into this while reading the post [Blogging for smaller audiences and deeper connections](https://herbertlui.net/blogging-for-smaller-audiences-and-deeper-connections/) by [Herbert Lui](https://herbertlui.net/). 

Looking at [other posts](https://www.inevitable.live/algorithm), it looks like he or at least someone is actively posting.
