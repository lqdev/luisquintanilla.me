> Google Cloud’s new partnership with AI model repository Hugging Face is letting developers build, train, and deploy AI models without needing to pay for a Google Cloud subscription. Now, outside developers using Hugging Face’s platform will have “cost-effective” access to Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) and GPU supercomputers, which will include thousands of Nvidia’s in-demand and export-restricted H100s.

> Google said that Hugging Face users can begin using the AI app-building platform Vertex AI and the Kubernetes engine that helps train and fine-tune models “in the first half of 2024.”
