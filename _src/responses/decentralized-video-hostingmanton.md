The recent news of the Vimeo acquisition aren't encouraging in terms of competition in the space.

Aside from the problem of infrastructure and technical solution availability, the biggest blocker seems to be cost. PeerTube for example is great, but the storage, networking, and maintenance costs even for a single user instance make you think twice when compared to $0 and no maintenance on YouTube.
