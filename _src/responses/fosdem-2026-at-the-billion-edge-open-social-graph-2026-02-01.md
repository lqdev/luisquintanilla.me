This talk by Alexander was great. It was effectively a tour of the new docs for AT Protocol which look amazing. Can't wait to dig into them once they're published and learn more about it. I'm already thinking about things I'd like to implement with it. The callback to writing Map Reduce jobs in Hadoop for large scale social media analytics brought back so many memories.
