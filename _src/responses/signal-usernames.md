> Signal’s mission and sole focus is private communication. For years, Signal has kept your messages private, your profile information (like your name and profile photo) private, your contacts private, and your groups private – among much else. Now we’re taking that one step further, by making your phone number on Signal more private.  
> <br>
> Here’s how:  
> <br>
> New default: Your phone number will no longer be visible to everyone in Signal...  
> <br>
> Connect without sharing your phone number...  
> <br>
> Control who can find you on Signal by phone number...  
> <br>
> Right now, these options are in beta, and will be rolling out to everyone in the coming weeks.
