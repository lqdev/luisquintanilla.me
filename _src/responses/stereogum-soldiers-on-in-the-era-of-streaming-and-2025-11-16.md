> Lapatine says his goal has always been to operate with transparency. He wants Stereogum to feel like talking to a friend who goes to shows and tells you about cool stuff on Bandcamp. Ultimately, he wants to build a connection with readers, help them find good music, and do it with personality. That human element is key because, he says, “I’ve never discovered anyone from the algorithm.”
