> If 2025 was about the fediverse — with new activity from Ghost, Flipboard, WordPress, and also newer platforms — I think 2026 will be a partial reset to the IndieWeb. More blogs. More independent voices, as diverse as the web. More platforms and bridges that span multiple protocols.

Looking forward to it.
