Not a WordPress user but this is cool, especially this - *"Build an entire site, save it, host it"*

> WordPress Playground makes WordPress instantly accessible for users, learners, extenders, and contributors. You can:
> 
>  - Try a block, a theme, or a plugin
>  - Build an entire site, save it, host it
>  - Test your plugin with many specific WordPress and PHP versions
>  - Embed a real, interactive WordPress site in your tutorial or course
>  - Showcase a plugin or theme on your website
>  - Preview pull requests from your repository
>  - â€¦or even run WordPress locally using the VisualStudio Code plugin or a CLI tool called wp-now
