> Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best coding model in the world. It's the strongest model for building complex agents. Itâ€™s the best model at using computers. And it shows substantial gains in reasoning and math.

> We've spent more than six months shipping updates to Claude Code, so we know what it takes to [build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAQJvGjlgVM) and [design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIDHi-1PVU) AI agents. We've solved hard problems: how agents should manage memory across long-running tasks, how to handle permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and how to coordinate subagents working toward a shared goal.
