> We believe artificial intelligence has the power to save the world—and that a thriving open source ecosystem is essential to building this future.

> To help close this resource gap, we’re announcing today the a16z Open Source AI Grant program. We’ll support a small group of open source developers through grant funding (not an investment or SAFE note), giving them the opportunity to continue their work without the pressure to generate financial returns.
