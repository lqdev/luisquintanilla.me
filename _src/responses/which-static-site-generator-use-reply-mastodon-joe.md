When I first started, I used Hexo. 

Then, I moved to Hugo. 

Ultimately though, I decided to roll my own. 

Currently my site's content and the generator live in the same [repo](https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me). 

While not up to date, my [colophon](/colophon) contains details of how my site is built. The [README](https://github.com/lqdev/luisquintanilla.me/blob/main/README.md) in the repo also contains more up to date information since the massive revamp I made last month (which I still need to write about). I think that revamp and decoupling of various components in my site would've been significantly harder had I not been in complete control of my codebase. 

Although I have to pay a maintenance toll by owning the code that generates my site, knowing the entire codebase also gives me freedom to experiment and explore.
