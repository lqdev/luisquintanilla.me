I love the Fediverse but there are costs to federation and the cost of running a single user instance isn't amortized. I love having a static site and while I've added a ton of new features to my site, it's all still a bunch of static files. I know if I want to participate in the Fediverse, I'll have to host something to connect and interact with the ecosystem. That something though should be lightweight, cost-effective, and easy to maintain. My preference would be for my website to be my central digital hub that also knows how to "talk" different protocols like ActivityPub or AT Proto. Whatever I end up hosting would act as the bridge between my site and those ecosystems. Ultimately though, when possible, I'd prefer for a majority of my site components to remain static files.
