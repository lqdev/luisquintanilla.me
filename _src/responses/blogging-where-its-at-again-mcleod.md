> the blog is the “natural form” of posting on the web: a site of your own, that you control[1] and set your own rules on content and discussion; where you can post whatever you like without worrying about “The Algorithm”

> For better or for worse, social media opened up the web to a lot more people for a number of reasons...But deep down I feel having your own site is better. For the web, and for you: the writer and the reader.

> ...stumbling into such a trove of active blogs has enthused me about blogging as a medium again. It’s sparked a thought that through a combination of increased blogging activity, declining platforms, and increasing adoption of open standards to glue everything together, that maybe — just maybe — we can swing the web back towards the blog again.

Agree with many of the points. Also, TIL you could subscribe to OPML feeds.
