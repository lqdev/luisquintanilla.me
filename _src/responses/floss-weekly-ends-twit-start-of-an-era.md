> After 17 years and 761 episodes, FLOSS Weekly ended its run on the TWiT network yesterday.

Nooo! So sad to hear that FLOSS Weekly is ending, especially after learning that [The Privacy, Security, and OSINT Show with Michael Bazzell ended as well](/feed/farewell-privacy-security-osint-podcast). 

At least there's some hope at the end of Doc's post which hints at it living on in some form.

> By the way, FLOSS Weekly has not slipped below the waves. I expect it will be picked up somewhere else on the Web, and wherever you get your podcasts. (I love that expression because it means podcasting isn’t walled into some giant’s garden.) When that happens, I’ll point to it here.

In any case, it was good while it lasted. Also, there's still [Reality 2.0](https://www.reality2cast.com/) where the guests and topics are just as interesting and entertaining.
