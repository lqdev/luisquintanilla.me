> In my experience, the supermajority of engagement on viral AI Facebook pages is just as artificially-generated as the content they publish.

> Whether it's a child transforming into a water bottle cyborg, a three-armed flight attendant rescuing Tiger Jesus from a muddy plane crash, or a hybrid human-monkey baby being stung to death by giant hornets, all tend to have copy+pasted captions, reactions & comments which usually make no sense in the observed context.

I've noticed similar patterns on YouTube. Sometime the comments include timestamp links which makes them seem more credible, but upon further inspection, it's all bot activity.
