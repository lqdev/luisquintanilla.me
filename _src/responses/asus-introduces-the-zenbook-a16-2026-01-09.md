> The new Zenbook A16 is among the very first laptops equipped with the flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme SoC, an 18-core monster with a 5.0GHz boost, Qualcomm's most powerful GPU yet, and massively increased memory bandwidth compared to other Snapdragon X2 chips.

The specs on the A16 sound amazing. Especially the 48GB of RAM configuration. I'd love to get my hands on one but I imagine it won't be cheap.
