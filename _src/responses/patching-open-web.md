I've been doing something similar to readlists, except with RSS feeds. I create a [custom recipe in Calibre](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/news.html) which pulls and aggregates the 50 latest articles for each feed in my recipe. I limit it to only look at articles published in the past day since I do this every evening. Think of it like the evening paper. The result is an EPUB file which I then import into my e-book reader. 

A few advantages I've found to doing this are:

- I take a break from the computer.
- Since the e-book reader is offline, I focus on reading the article and don't have the option to click on links and get distracted browsing the internet. 
- Since I'm already using the e-book reader, it's easy to transition to reading a book.
