> Smartphones and physical keyboards aren’t a combination we think of often, but Clicks for iPhone is trying to bring that back with a new keyboard case that’s extremely good. 

Wishful thinking on my end but I'd buy a Blackberry-like device. Not a "smartphone", but an internet-connected device with all the phone capabilities that has a physical keyboard.
