> I decided to launch another newsletter called Dealgorithmed. Will start on January 1st, delivered every 1st and 15th of every month. It’s gonna be a discovery newsletter focused on the personal/independent/whimsical/indie web.

> The fact that people keep browsing the same 3 sites, day after day, getting served content by algorithms controlled by 3 companies is such a shame. Because there is so much interesting content out there ready to be discovered. And discovering new content also means connecting with new people, getting exposed to new ideas, different cultures. That’s by far the best quality of the web if you ask me.

> The problem many people are facing is how to find that content, how to escape the algorithmic bubble. I think the only answer to that is curation.

> The goal with [Dealgorithmed](https://buttondown.com/dealgorithmed) is to provide interesting content gathered from all around the web in a convenient package delivered in your inbox twice a month. Content that you can then use as a starting point for your own internet explorations.
