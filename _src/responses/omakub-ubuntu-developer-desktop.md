Cool project. 

> Turn a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. 

> Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

> Omakub includes a curated set of applications and tools that one might discover through hours of watching YouTube, reading blogs, or just stumbling around Linux internet. All so someone coming straight from a platform like Windows or the Mac can immediately start enjoying a ready-made system, without having to do any configuration and curation legwork at all.
