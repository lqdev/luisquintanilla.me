> We're A New Social, a new non-profit organization focused on building cross-protocol tools and services for the open social web.  
> <br>
> Our mission is to liberate people's networks from their platforms, enabling [The Last Network Effect](https://www.augment.ink/bridges-the-last-network-effect/?ref=anew.social) and leveling the playing field across the open social web.  
> <br>
> The first project we'll take on to accomplish this mission is [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/?ref=anew.social), a service that enables users of ActivityPub-based platforms like Mastodon, ATProto-based platforms like Bluesky, and websites to interact and engage across ecosystems.
