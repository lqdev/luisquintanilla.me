> Through the iterative, evaluation-driven process weâ€™ve described in this post, we've identified consistent patterns in what makes tools successful: Effective tools are intentionally and clearly defined, use agent context judiciously, can be combined together in diverse workflows, and enable agents to intuitively solve real-world tasks.
