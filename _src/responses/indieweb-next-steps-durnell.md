Great post. 

One of the challenges I've found, even when using appliances like those from hosting providers like [Linode](https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/linode/wordpress/) or tools like [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org/) is connecting them to your domain. 

Usually, that's specific to your domain name provider and usually a manual process. 

In cases where that's easy, you're often overcharged for the convenience. Compared to "free" social media and publishing websites, it makes using your own domain a less desirable option.  

Maybe advocating for a multi-staged approach like [IndieWebify.Me](https://indiewebify.me/) could make the journey more approachable. More importantly, making it a journey, rather than a destination could help with meeting folks where they are and guide them closer towards their goals. 

In any case, the proposed list of goals seem like a great start towards helping people create their own place on the web.
