> Key Takeaways:  
> <br>
> Today, we’re publishing our research paper that dives into the underlying technology powering Stable Diffusion 3.  
> <br>
> Stable Diffusion 3 outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image generation systems such as DALL·E 3, Midjourney v6, and Ideogram v1 in typography and prompt adherence, based on human preference evaluations.  
> <br>
> Our new Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture uses separate sets of weights for image and language representations, which improves text understanding and spelling capabilities compared to previous versions of SD3.
