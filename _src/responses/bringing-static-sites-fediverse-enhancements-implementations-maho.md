Awesome post from my friend [maho.dev](https://maho.dev/)

> I’ve introduced customizable templates for note generation. This enhancement allows the full content of a blog post to be included directly in ActivityPub notes, moving beyond mere link sharing—a practice often associated with bots—and leveraging the full potential of the Fediverse.

This is cool. I'd like something better for my POSSE setup. Might give this a try.
