> Our video generation model is rolling out at [sora.com⁠](https://sora.com).

> Users can generate videos up to 1080p resolution, up to 20 sec long, and in widescreen, vertical or square aspect ratios. You can bring your own assets to extend, remix, and blend, or generate entirely new content from text.

> The version of Sora we are deploying has many limitations. It often generates unrealistic physics and struggles with complex actions over long durations.

> We’re introducing our video generation technology now to give society time to explore its possibilities and co-develop norms and safeguards that ensure it’s used responsibly as the field advances.
