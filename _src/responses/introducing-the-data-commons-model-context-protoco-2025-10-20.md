> We are excited to announce the public release of the Data Commons Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server. This release marks a major milestone in making all of Data Commonsâ€™ vast and interconnected public datasets instantly accessible and actionable for AI developers, data scientists and organizations worldwide. This capability further supports the larger ambition of Data Commons: using real-world statistical information as an anchor to help reduce Large Language Model (LLM) hallucinations.
