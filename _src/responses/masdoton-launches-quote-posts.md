> Starting next week, you’ll see an option to quote another user by selecting the repost — or “boost” — button, allowing you to add your thoughts to someone else’s post.

> Mastodon is bringing quote posts to mastodon.online and mastodon.social first, but will roll out the feature more broadly with the Mastodon 4.5 update.

> t also worked on a technical [specification](https://codeberg.org/fediverse/fep/src/branch/main/fep/044f/fep-044f.md) for quote posting in the fediverse and hopes that other platforms will adopt it.
