> A new web search API is now available in Ollama. Ollama provides a generous free tier of web searches for individuals to use, and higher rate limits are available via [Ollama’s cloud](https://ollama.com/cloud).

> Web search is provided as a REST API with deeper tool integrations in Ollama’s Python and JavaScript libraries. This also enables models such as OpenAI’s [gpt-oss](https://ollama.com/library/gpt-oss) models to conduct long-running research tasks.
