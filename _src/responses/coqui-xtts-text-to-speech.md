[XTTS](https://huggingface.co/coqui/XTTS-v1) is a Voice generation model that lets you clone voices into different languages by using just a quick 3-second audio clip. 

XTTS is built on previous research, like Tortoise, with additional architectural innovations and training to make cross-language voice cloning and multilingual speech generation possible.
