So excited to see the [AI Dev Gallery is now in the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n9pn1mm3bd5). 

Through various interactive samples, developers get to see how they might use AI for different tasks like text classification, object detection, and many others.

Best of all, the models are all running locally and you get to see and export the C# code powering the samples to Visual Studio to continue tinkering on your own and integrate into your own applications. 

A few months ago, the team came on the .NET AI Community Standup to showcase the app. Since then, it's only kept improving and introducing new scenarios. 

You can check out the recording from that stream here.
