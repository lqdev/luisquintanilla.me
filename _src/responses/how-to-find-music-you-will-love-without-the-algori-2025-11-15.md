> With less involvement from the listener, less intentionality, it’s easy for music to simply become [background noise](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/2/17805138/finding-silence-online-is-difficult-but-the-pursuit-is-worthwhile). Research suggests that younger generations are [discovering new artists at a lower rate](https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports/all-eyes-no-ears-why-virality-is-not-building-fandom?preview=true) than previous ones, and there’s a direct correlation between lower levels of music discovery and reliance on the algorithm. So, how do you [find new music with intention](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16840940/spotify-algorithm-music-discovery-mix-cds-resolution)?

> The simplest and most traditional is through music media. There are countless sources of excellent music journalism and criticism, it’s just a matter of finding one that speaks to you.

> Just like everything else on the internet, music has its influencers.

> Sort of straddling the line between traditional music media and influencers is the world of Substack. There are tons of newsletters out there that serve up artist interviews, curated playlists, and deep dives into bands’ discographies.

> Traditional radio can still be a solid source of new music if you turn away from large commercial stations owned by iHeartRadio and the like. Your local college station is a good place to start, but there are other non-commercial independent stations out there, like [WFMU](https://wfmu.org/) in New York, that steer clear of your standard pop fare.

> In addition to traditional terrestrial stations, there are streaming internet stations. [NTS Radio](https://www.nts.live/) is one of the best...

> ...you should become a fan of labels, not just artists.

> Ultimately, record labels are curators, and the best ones have a distinct identity. That doesn’t necessarily only mean releasing death metal records (though it can). It means building a vibe and a particular point of view that unifies the artists under a single umbrella.

> ...easily the best way to find new and interesting music is just to connect with other people who share your tastes. This can be as simple as getting recommendations from [friends](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24134059/music-league-spotify-algorithm-antidote) or an older sibling. (Or, if you’re trying to stay on top of things as you get older, a younger sibling.) But there are plenty of online communities for getting music recommendations.

> Lastly, go see live music. Go see a band you know, but make sure you get there for the opener.

Great list. I've had success with all of these. Some examples.

- NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts is how I discovered [Chicano Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOwpqDhko3c)
- 107.1 Chicago Independent Radio Project (CHIRP) is how I discovered [Lingua Ignota](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axb6IOROufo). Here's a list of other [radio stations I listen to](/radio)
- [Salami Rose Joe Louis](https://www.salamirosejoelouis.com/) was an opener for [Flying Lotus](https://flying-lotus.com/). 
- As a Flying Lotus fan, I also follow many of the artists signed to his label, [Brainfeeder](https://brainfeeder.net/)

As I discover music, I try to curate my findings through [playlists](/collections/playlists/)
