I've had this song on repeat since[Friday](/feed/new-flying-lotus-garmonbozia/). Also, I didn't know the name of the song is a [Twin Peaks](https://twinpeaks.fandom.com/wiki/Garmonbozia) reference. Given his recent focus as a composer, I hope this means there's a bigger Twin Peaks project or collaboration in the works.
