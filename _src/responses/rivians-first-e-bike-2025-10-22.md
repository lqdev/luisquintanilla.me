> Rivian’s micromobility spinoff Also has just taken the wraps off its TM-B e-bike, TM-Q pedal-assisted electric quad bike, and Alpha Wave helmet that represents “a breakthrough in rider safety and connectivity".

Really cool, but at $4k+ it seems pricey. Given it's Rivian's entry into the market it makes sense. As more of these sell and hit the market, hopefully the prices also start to come down.
