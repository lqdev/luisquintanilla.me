These updates are exciting!

> [Reddit appears to be building out new Chat functionality](https://macaw.social/@wongmjane/109529583352532543) using Matrix

> [Discourse](https://meta.discourse.org/t/matrix-protocol-for-chat/210780) is working on adding Matrix support

> [Thunderbird](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/30/thunderbird_102) launched Matrix support.

> Automattic is busy building [Matrix plugins for Wordpress](https://github.com/Automattic/chatrix)

Not as exciting

> ...only a handful of these initiatives have resulted in funding reaching the core Matrix team. **This is directly putting core Matrix development at risk.**

> In short: folks love the amazing decentralised encrypted comms utopia of Matrix. But organisations also love that they can use it without having to pay anyone to develop or maintain it. **This is completely unsustainable**, and Element is now literally unable to fund the entirety of the Matrix Foundation on behalf of everyone else - and has had to lay off some of the folks working on the core team as a result.

> In the interim, if you are an organisation whoâ€™s building on Matrix and you want the project to continue to flourish, please mail funding@matrix.org to discuss how you can support the foundations that you are depending on.

I'm looking forward to the future of the Matrix protocol, especially the [P2P components](https://arewep2pyet.com/).
