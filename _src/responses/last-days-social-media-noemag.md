> Social media was built on the romance of authenticity. Early platforms sold themselves as conduits for genuine connection: stuff you wanted to see, like your friend’s wedding and your cousin’s dog.

> The feed no longer feels crowded with people but crowded with content. At this point, it has far less to do with people than with consumers and consumption.

> Whatever remains of genuine, human content is increasingly sidelined by algorithmic prioritization, receiving fewer interactions than the engineered content and AI slop optimized solely for clicks. 

> While content proliferates, engagement is evaporating...People aren’t connecting or conversing on social media like they used to; they’re just wading through slop, that is, low-effort, low-quality content produced at scale, often with AI, for engagement.

> Engagement is now about raw user attention – time spent, impressions, scroll velocity – and the net effect is an online world in which you are constantly being addressed but never truly spoken to.

> Social media’s death rattle will not be a bang but a shrug.

> These networks once promised a single interface for the whole of online life...But now, the model is splintering, and users are drifting toward smaller, slower, more private spaces, like group chats, Discord servers and [federated microblogs](https://www.theverge.com/24063290/fediverse-explained-activitypub-social-media-open-protocol) — a billion little gardens.

> Intentional, opt-in micro‑communities are rising in their place — like Patreon collectives and Substack newsletters — where creators chase depth over scale, retention over virality. A writer with 10,000 devoted subscribers can potentially earn more and burn out less than one with a million passive followers on Instagram. 

> These are the last days of social media, not because we lack content, but because the attention economy has neared its outer limit — we have exhausted the capacity to care.

> Our offline reality is irrevocably shaped by our online world. Consider the worker who deletes or was never on LinkedIn, excluding themselves from professional networks that increasingly exist nowhere else

> These platforms haven’t just captured attention, they’ve enclosed the commons where social, economic and cultural capital are exchanged. But enclosure breeds resistance, and as exhaustion sets in, alternatives begin to emerge.

> ...as social media collapses on itself, the future points to a quieter, more fractured, more human web, something that no longer promises to be everything, everywhere, for everyone.

> We can dream of a digital future where belonging is no longer measured by follower counts or engagement rates, but rather by the development of trust and the quality of conversation...None of this is about escaping the social internet, but about reclaiming its scale, pace, and purpose.

> The technical architecture of the next social web is already emerging through federated and distributed protocols like ActivityPub...But protocols alone won’t save us. The email protocol is decentralized, yet most email flows through a handful of corporate providers. We need to “rewild the internet,” as Maria Farrell and Robin Berjon mentioned in a Noema essay.

> Social media as we know it is dying, but we’re not condemned to its ruins. We are capable of building better — smaller, slower, more intentional, more accountable — spaces for digital interaction, spaces where the metrics that matter aren’t engagement and growth but understanding and connection, where algorithms serve the community rather than strip-mining it.

> The last days of social media might be the first days of something more human: a web that remembers why we came online in the first place — not to be harvested but to be heard, not to go viral but to find our people, not to scroll but to connect. We built these systems, and we can certainly build better ones. The question is whether we will do this or whether we will continue to drown.
