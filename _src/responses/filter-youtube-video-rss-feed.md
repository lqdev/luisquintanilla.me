As someone who subscribes to YouTube channels using RSS feeds, I found this incredibly useful.

```text
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=UU<channel id>
```

> Notice the UU and look below what you can replace it with.

```text
UU - all public uploads (same as the channel_id= url)
UULF - all public videos
UUMO - all member videos 
UULV - all live streams
UUSH - all shorts
UULP - popular videos
UUPV - popular live streams
UUPS - popular shorts
UUMV - member live streams
UUMS - member shorts
```
