> At GitHub Universe, we’re announcing Agent HQ, GitHub’s vision for the next evolution of our platform. Agents shouldn’t be bolted on. They should work the way you already work. That’s why we’re making agents native to the GitHub flow.  
> <br>
> Agent HQ transforms GitHub into an open ecosystem that unites every agent on a single platform. Over the coming months, coding agents from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cognition, xAI, and more will become available directly within GitHub as part of your paid GitHub Copilot subscription.
