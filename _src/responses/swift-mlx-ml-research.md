> The Swift programming language has a lot of potential to be used for machine learning research because it combines the ease of use and high-level syntax of a language like Python with the speed of a compiled language like C++.
> 
> [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) is an array framework for machine learning research on Apple silicon. MLX is intended for research and not for production deployment of models in apps.
> 
> [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift/) expands MLX to the Swift language, making experimentation on Apple silicon easier for ML researchers.
