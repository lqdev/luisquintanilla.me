> We backed up Spotify (metadata and music files). It’s distributed in bulk torrents (~300TB), grouped by popularity.  
> <br>
> This release includes the largest publicly available music metadata database with 256 million tracks and 186 million unique ISRCs.  
> <br>
> It’s the world’s first “preservation archive” for music which is fully open (meaning it can easily be mirrored by anyone with enough disk space), with 86 million music files, representing around 99.6% of listens.
