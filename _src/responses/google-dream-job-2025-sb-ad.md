I didn't watch the Super Bowl this year so I didn't get a chance to watch the ads until a few days later. 

From the ones I saw, I think Google's was my favorite. 

Apart from the touching story, what stood out to me the most was its focus on humanity, with technology playing a supporting role rather than being the main character.
