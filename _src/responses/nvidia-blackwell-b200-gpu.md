> Nvidia reveals Blackwell B200 GPU, the ‘world’s most powerful chip’ for AI

> ‘Built to democratize trillion-parameter AI.’

> Nvidia says the new B200 GPU offers up to 20 petaflops of FP4 horsepower from its 208 billion transistors. Also, it says, a GB200 that combines two of those GPUs with a single Grace CPU can offer 30 times the performance for LLM inference workloads while also potentially being substantially more efficient. It “reduces cost and energy consumption by up to 25x” over an H100, says Nvidia.
