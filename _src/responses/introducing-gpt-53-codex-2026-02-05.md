> We’re introducing a new model that unlocks even more of what Codex can do: GPT‑5.3-Codex, the most capable agentic coding model to date. The model advances both the frontier coding performance of GPT‑5.2-Codex and the reasoning and professional knowledge capabilities of GPT‑5.2, together in one model, which is also 25% faster. This enables it to take on long-running tasks that involve research, tool use, and complex execution. Much like a colleague, you can steer and interact with GPT‑5.3-Codex while it’s working, without losing context.

GPT‑5.3‑Codex is our first model that was instrumental in creating itself. The Codex team used early versions to debug its own training, manage its own deployment, and diagnose test results and evaluations—our team was blown away by how much Codex was able to accelerate its own development.

With GPT‑5.3-Codex, Codex goes from an agent that can write and review code to an agent that can do nearly anything developers and professionals can do on a computer.
