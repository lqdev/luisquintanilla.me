You can access my site at [lqdev.me](https://www.lqdev.me). If your reader does auto-discovery, it should automagically pick up the feeds. Alternatively, here's a list of my [feeds](https://lqdev.me/feed/) which you can also import using OPML. On the site, I mostly write about open-source, Indieweb, and AI projects I'm tinkering with. You'll also find me sharing articles, videos, and music that interest me. 

P.S. I'm slowly working my way through your Phantom Fluency post. Great work with Phantom Obligation. [It resonated with me](https://lqdev.me/responses/phantom-obligation-2026-01-28/).
