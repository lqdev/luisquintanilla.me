> ... Wirecutter picks the 3 best journaling apps of 2026. (It’s Day One.)

I love Day One. I've found myself using it more and more lately mostly as a pastebin and a way to share things between my phone and laptop. Most recently though I've also been using it to capture ideas and draft blog posts. Day One is a good place to iterate on a piece over time without the pressure to write and publish in one shot.
