Although I still use some of the streaming platforms, I've been slowly rebuilding my analog media collection over the last few years. That includes [books, movies, and music](/notes/am-i-in-2006-newspapers-cds-mp3s).

I wish there were more options for dedicated MP3 players. Everything is either cheaply made or very expensive. Midrange options end up being stripped down Android phones.
