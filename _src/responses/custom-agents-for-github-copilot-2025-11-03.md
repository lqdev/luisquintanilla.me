> Custom agents for GitHub Copilot make it easy for users and organizations to specialize their Copilot coding agent (CCA) through simple, file-based configurations.  
> <br>
> By adding a configuration file under `.github/agents` in a repository or in the `{org}/.github` repository, you can define agent personas that capture your team’s workflows, conventions, and unique needs. These agents can be further tailored with prompts, tool selections, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to optimize for specific use cases.
