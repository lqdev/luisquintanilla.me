> Here are a bunch of not-so-obvious lessons I’ve internalized through writing each day:
> 
> - Writing can be a starting point, not an ending one
> - Write to think
> - The power of DIFY: Do it for yourself, don’t think too much about what you want other people to get out of it.
> - Think small
> - Gain energy
> - A lot of books are collections of blog posts
> - Small is an unblocker
