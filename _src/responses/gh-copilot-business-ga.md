> GitHub Copilot for Business gives organizations:
> 
>  - **The power of AI**. Millions of developers have already used GitHub Copilot to build software faster, stay in the flow longer, and solve problems in new ways—all right from their editor of choice.
>  - **Simple license management**. Administrators can enable GitHub Copilot for their teams and select which organizations, teams, and developers receive licenses.
>  - **Organization-wide policy management**. You can easily set policy controls to enforce user settings for public code matching on behalf of your organization.
>  - **Your code is safe with us**. With Copilot for Business, we won’t retain code snippets, store or share your code regardless if the data is from public repositories, private repositories, non-GitHub repositories, or local files.
