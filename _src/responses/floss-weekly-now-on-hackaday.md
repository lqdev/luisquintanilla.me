> Weâ€™re excited to announce that Hackaday is the new home of FLOSS Weekly, a long-running podcast about free, libre, and open-source software! The TWiT network hosted the podcast for an incredible seventeen years, but due to some changes on their end, they recently had to wind things down. They were gracious enough to let us pick up the torch, with Jonathan Bennett now taking over hosting duties.

That didn't take long. Last month [I learned FLOSS Weekly was ending on the TWiT network](/responses/floss-weekly-ends-twit-start-of-an-era/). It's great to see it has found a new home in Hackaday! Time to update the RSS feeds and [podroll](/collections/podroll/).
