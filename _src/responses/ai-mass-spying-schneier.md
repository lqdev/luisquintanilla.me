> Surveillance facilitates social control, and spying will only make this worse. Governments around the world already use mass surveillance; they will engage in mass spying as well.

> Mass surveillance ushered in the era of personalized advertisements; mass spying will supercharge that industry...The tech monopolies that are currently keeping us all under constant surveillance won’t be able to resist collecting and using all of that data.

> We could limit this capability. We could prohibit mass spying. We could pass strong data-privacy rules. But we haven’t done anything to limit mass surveillance. Why would spying be any different?
