This is amazing news! By the time I decided to get a Pebble, they'd already been sold to Google. 

I agree with Eric's points here:

> I've tried every single smart watch out there, but none do it for me. No one makes a smartwatch with the core set of features I want:

> - **Always-on e-paper screen** (it’s reflective rather than emissive. Sunlight readable. Glanceable. Not distracting to others like a bright wrist)
> - **Long battery life** (one less thing to charge. It’s annoying to need extra cables when traveling)
Simple and beautiful user experience around a core set of features I use regularly (telling time, notifications, music control, alarms, weather, calendar, sleep/step tracking)
> - **Buttons!** (to play/pause/skip music on my phone without looking at the screen)
> - **Hackable** (apparently you can’t even write your own watchfaces for Apple Watch? That is wild. There were >16k watchfaces on the Pebble appstore!)

Garmin is the closest I've come to it at least on the battery life and buttons front. Pebble was one-of-a-kind.

I already signed up to stay up to date with the project and plan on being a day one customer. You can too at [repebble.com](https://repebble.com/).

P.S. While not surprised, I didn't know Eric was behind another amazing project I'm a fan of, [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/).
