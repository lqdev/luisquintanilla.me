> A TUI (text user interface) is a holistic model, view, and controller implemented using character graphics.
TUIs, like WIMP3 GUIs, freely move the cursor around their rectilinear display, as opposed to line-oriented
CLIs and their ineluctable marches through the scrolling region.
Given the same interactive task
> 
> • A TUI implementation is almost certainly a smaller memory and disk footprint than a GUI,  
> • a good TUI implementation might introduce less latency, and  
> • a properly-done TUI implementation can often be significantly more portable.
