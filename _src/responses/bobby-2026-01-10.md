> It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir.

> His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them. Every chord he played, every word he sang was an integral part of the stories he wove. There was an invitation: to feel, to question, to wander, and to belong. 

> There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again.

> May we honor him not only in sorrow, but in how bravely we continue with open hearts, steady steps, and the music leading us home. Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.

R.I.P Bob Weir
