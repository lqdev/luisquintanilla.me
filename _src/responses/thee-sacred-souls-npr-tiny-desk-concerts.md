> San Diego-based trio [Thee Sacred Souls](https://www.npr.org/artists/1106773743/thee-sacred-souls) made its mark at the Tiny Desk with satin vocals and vintage melodies. Paying homage to southern California Latino culture meeting American soul roots, the group's sweet fusion melodies brought history and love into the space.
