> Last night Organic Maps was removed from the Play Store without any warnings or additional details due to "not meeting the requirements for the Family Program". Compared to Google Maps and other maps apps rated for 3+ age, there are no ads or in-app purchases in Organic Maps. We have asked for an appeal. 

The app is still available on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/app.organicmaps/). Much better place for getting apps in my opinion.
