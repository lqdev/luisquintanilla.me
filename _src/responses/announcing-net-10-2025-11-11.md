> Today, we are excited to announce the launch of .NET 10, the most productive, modern, secure, intelligent, and performant release of .NET yet. It’s the result of another year of effort from thousands of developers around the world. This release includes thousands of performance, security, and functional improvements across the entire .NET stack-from languages and developer tools to workloads-enabling you to build with a unified platform and easily infuse your apps with AI.

It's here! Congrats to the team and everyone behind this release.
