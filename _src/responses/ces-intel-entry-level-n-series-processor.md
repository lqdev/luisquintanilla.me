The article suggests these processors are for the education market. Hopefully a few of the devices with these processors in a Surface Go form-factor are made generally available as well. I think the N200 series is the sweet spot in terms of performance and battery life with only 6W of max turbo power. The i3 which draws a max of 15W may be too much. At that point, some of the newly announced [U-series processors](https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/computers-desktops/13th-gen-intel-core-mobile-cpus-announced-ces-2023) might make more sense.
