> Today we are releasing Stable Video 3D (SV3D), a generative model based on Stable Video Diffusion, advancing the field of 3D technology and delivering greatly improved quality and view-consistency.  
> <br>
> This release features two variants: SV3D_u and SV3D_p. SV3D_u generates orbital videos based on single image inputs without camera conditioning. SV3D_p extends the capability by accommodating both single images and orbital views, allowing for the creation of 3D video along specified camera paths.

> Stable Video 3D can be used now for commercial purposes with a Stability AI Membership. For non-commercial use, you can download the model weights on Hugging Face and view our research paper here.
