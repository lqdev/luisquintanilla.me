> This blog post introduces mmBERT, a state-of-the-art massively multilingual encoder model trained on 3T+ tokens of text in over 1800 languages. It shows significant performance and speed improvements over previous multilingual models, being the first to improve upon XLM-R, while also developing new strategies for effectively learning low-resource languages. mmBERT builds upon ModernBERT for a blazingly fast architecture, and adds novel components to enable efficient multilingual learning.
