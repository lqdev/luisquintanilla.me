> We are halfway into Web 3.0. The Computational Web has tossed a lot of hefty promises into that Trojan Horse we call AI—ending world hunger, poverty, and global warming just to name a few. But this is for all the marbles. Promises of utopia are not enough. They must scared the shit out of us, too, by implying that AI in the wrong hands can bring about a literal apocalypse.

So, how will Web 3.0 end?

> On New Year's, I made a couple of silly tech predictions for 2026 (because it's fun guessing what our tech overlords will do to become a literal Prometheus). ￼ The first prediction is innocuous enough. I think personal website URLs will become a status symbol on social media bios for mainstream content creators. Linktrees are out. Funky blogs with GIFs and neon typography are in. God, how I hope this one happens. Not even for nostalgia. In the hyper-scaled, for-profit web, personal websites are an act of defiance. It's subversive. ￼It's punk.

> My second 2026 prediction, something, for the record, I do not hope happens, is an attack on local computing.

A future with more ownership of our digital spaces and devices is one I can get behind.
