This is such a beautiful album. It seems I'm not the only one that thinks so since it's rated as the [#1 album of all time by Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on-4-1063232/). The powerful messages in the lyrics still resonate to this day and the composition is such a perfect match for Marvin Gaye's voice. 50 years later it feels like this album has transcended space and time.

Over the past few days, I've listened to it from beginning to end at least 3 times. 

Of course there's the classics like *What's Going On* and *Mercy Mercy Me* that many people know. However, the ones that have quickly become my favorites are: 

## *Save The Children*

## *God Is Love*
