> ExecuTorch enables seamless, production-ready deployment of PyTorch models directly to edge devices (mobile, embedded, desktop) without the need for conversion or rewriting, supporting a wide range of hardware backends and model types.

> ExecuTorch 1.0 release delivers broader hardware support across CPU, GPU, and NPU, greater stability for production use, and robust model compatibility.
