>... one unexpected source of music discovery is quietly booming among Gen Z listeners: college radio.

> I spoke to seven student general managers and surveyed 80+ DJs at stations across America...They told me student interest in college radio has dramatically increased in recent years. Stations that once struggled to fill airtime are now turning people away, shortening shows, alternating time slots, and running training programs just to keep up with the demand from aspiring [student DJs](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTHWbFPqKktjg-IRGCY/).

> ## What’s Driving the College Radio Renaissance?  
> <br>
> ### 1. Algorithm fatigue  
> <br>
> Students consistently described radio as an authentic, community-driven refuge from the passive, isolated, algorithm-driven digital experiences that have defined their adolescence  
> <br>
> ### 2. Analog Nostalgia  
> <br>
> The [resurgence](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/24/opinion/gen-z-technology-nostalgia.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) of interest in physical media is a significant driver of Gen Z’s attraction to college radio...This manifests in a return to high-friction analog media like vinyl, flip phones, film cameras and radio.

> ### 3. Community, Creativity & Belonging  
> <br>  
> College radio stations serve as vital “third spaces” where students can find a community of like-minded people outside of classes and social media, said several GMs.

> In a moment when the wider industry is betting on algorithms, AI, and fleeting TikTok trends, these college radio DJs remind us that young people aren’t bored of music—they’re bored of the shallow, virality-obsessed way music is marketed to them.

As someone who listens to college football games on the radio, it's comforting to hear college radio stations are thriving.
