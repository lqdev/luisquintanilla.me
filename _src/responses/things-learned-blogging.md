Both this post as well as [Tom MacWright's "How to Blog"](https://macwright.com/2019/02/06/how-to-blog.html) resonate. I've been posting more consistently to my microblog feeds. These posts are more informal, but just the aspect of producing something even if it's just a short snippet is gratifying. The informality of it makes the posts significantly shorter but the pace at which I publish content and share ideas is faster.
