> The 2025 IndieWeb Gift Calendar is the 9th annual group effort to gift (ship) one or more IndieWeb-related thing(s) each day of December that others can use to improve their IndieWeb experience.

This is such a cool initiative. I'm thinking of making my [GitHub CMS](https://github.com/lqdev/testGHCMS/) project the gift this year. Technically, its usable today but still needs some polish and I need to find some time to write about it, architecture, and thinking behind it.
