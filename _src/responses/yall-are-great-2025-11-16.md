> This series lives on my blog but has nothing to do with me. It exists to connect you, the human who’s reading this, with all the other wonderful humans that are still out there, spending their time making sure the old school web, the one made by the people, for the people, is not dying.

> This is the web many people are missing, a web that is, in fact, still here, very much alive. Y’all are great.

Friday mornings are one of my favorites because I get to "meet" someone new through this series. Thanks for your work and dedication to this series.
