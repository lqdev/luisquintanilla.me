> ...[the NexPhone](https://nexphone.com/blog/the-tale-of-nexphone-one-phone-every-computer). It’s a midrange phone that’s designed to double as your computer and comes with Android and Linux installed, both of which will offer desktop experiences when plugged into a monitor.

It’s a delightfully geeky attempt to answer the age-old question: Why can’t your smartphone just be your whole dang computer?
