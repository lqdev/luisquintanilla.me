> the gift I most want for my 40th is something everyone can do.

> I want you to blog.

> Publish a post. About anything! It can be long or short, a photo or a video, maybe a quote or a link to something you found interesting. Don’t sweat it. Just blog. Share something you created, or amplify something you enjoyed. It doesn’t take much. The act of publishing will be a gift for you and me.  

> That’s it! No wrapping paper or bows. Just blogs and blogs and blogs, each unique and beautiful in its own way.
