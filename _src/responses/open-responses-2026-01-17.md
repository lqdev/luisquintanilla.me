> Open Responses is an open-source specification and ecosystem for building multi-provider, interoperable LLM interfaces based on the OpenAI Responses API. It defines a shared schema, and tooling layer that enable a unified experience for calling language models, streaming results, and composing agentic workflows—independent of provider.
