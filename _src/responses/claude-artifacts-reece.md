ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯. Artifacts are great. In ChatGPT when I find myself trying to format outputs as markdown, the UI gets confused and some of the content is rendered in markdown while the rest gets rendered as part of the UI which makes it unusable and hard to copy. The best way I've found to get around it is to ask it to format in org-mode or asciidoc. Claude Artifacts make this a non-issue. I also love that in addition to copying and downloading the artifact, you can also publish it as a URL.
