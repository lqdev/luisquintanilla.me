> "If you reject your own ideas, then the part of the brain that comes up with ideas is going to stop. You just do it and do it and do it, and you sort it out later."

> "I kind of just think everything I work on is good. I don't think I've ever done anything I'm not good enough to do because I get good at the thing while doing it. Looking back now, I think maybe there's things I could have done better. But I never really think about going back to a project past a few weeks because there's so much other stuff I want to make."

> Ideas are all around. The problem is, most people don't act on them. If you always reject your own ideas for not being good enough, or being impractical, or think you're not good enough to make them, or that you don't have enough time, or any other reason, it's like skipping brain day at the gym. You have to get what's in your brain out of it. Making your ideas a reality again and again is the only way to generate better ones over time.

Good food for thought.
