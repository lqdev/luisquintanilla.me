> When you choose to keep your notes in locally stored plain text files, you’re choosing to be your own landlord. Keeping notes in a proprietary app is the same as renting: the land you’re building on belongs to someone else, with no guarantee of continuing access.

This is so true for many other areas of our digital lives as well.
