> ...ImageBind, the first AI model capable of binding information from six modalities. The model learns a single embedding, or shared representation space, not just for text, image/video, and audio, but also for sensors that record depth (3D), thermal (infrared radiation), and inertial measurement units (IMU), which calculate motion and position.
