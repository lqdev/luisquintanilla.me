I did a first pass earlier today and I generally enjoyed this new album from Tyler. 

Like many previous albums, it's highly introspective. I loved the instrumentals as well.

Some first impressions:

- Track 10 is not a double track as it's generally been the case of his previous albums.
- "Like Him" adds a new contrasting dimension to Tyler's relationship with his father.

I'll need some more time to digest it and read through the lyrics but overall, great album.
