A few updates I found interesting. 

> The Beauty of languages: You can now use your own voice during a translated call in Skype.

> Universal translator: During a Skype call, if a participant speaks different languages, Skype Translator will automatically detect the languages and translate it for you.

> Extra! Extra! Read all about it: Stay up-to-date with the latest news and trends.

> Hit me up sometime: You can easily add contacts in Skype on mobile using a unique QR code to get connected.

I have a few thoughts on the [Today](https://support.skype.com/faq/FA34951/what-is-the-today-tab-in-skype-and-how-do-i-use-it) feature and overall updates Skype has been receiving over the past few months but I'll leave those for another post.
