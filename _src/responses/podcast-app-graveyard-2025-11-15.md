> One of the longest-running and most well-known podcast listening apps, Stitcher was officially shut down by SiriusXM on August 29, 2023. The app originally launched in 2008, and was famous for its ability to "stream" audio (without the need to manually sync audio files to your device).

While my first podcast "app" was Zune, Stitcher was the first third-party app I used on a smartphone. Good memories. RIP Stitcher
