> Today we're releasing Bonfire Social 1.0: a federated community‑first social network and the modular toolkit that powers it: a framework for building apps on the open social web beyond microblogging. We're pairing the launch with a crowdfund so communities drive what we build next.

Congrats on this launch! I personally don't self-host an instance but really like the problems the project aims to tackle.
