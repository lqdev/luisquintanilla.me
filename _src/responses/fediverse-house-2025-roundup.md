> No Walls, Just Vibes at SXSW’s Fediverse House

> Fediverse House was SXSW’s first physical gathering dedicated entirely to the constellation of interoperable social platforms powered by protocols like ActivityPub and AT Protocol. (We know “Fediverse” isn’t quite accurate to describe the whole ecosystem; in this case, it was just a convenient, fun way to name the space.)

> It didn’t matter which platform you preferred or which protocol you were building on; everyone was focused on the singular goal of building a better internet.

> ...the real power move for creators is ownership and control of their work and livelihoods.

> ...identity portability is a radical shift, and...decentralization could lead to more humane social spaces.
