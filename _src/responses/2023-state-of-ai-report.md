> Key themes in the 2023 Report include:
>   - **GPT-4 is the master of all it surveys (for now)**, beating every other LLM on both classic benchmarks and exams designed to evaluate humans, validating the power of proprietary architectures and reinforcement learning from human feedback.
>   - **Efforts are growing to try to clone or surpass proprietary performance**, through smaller models, better datasets, and longer context. These could gain new urgency, amid concerns that human-generated data may only be able to sustain AI scaling trends for a few more years.
>   - **LLMs and diffusion models continue to drive real-world breakthroughs**, especially in the life sciences, with meaningful steps forward in both molecular biology and drug discovery.
>   - **Compute is the new oil**, with NVIDIA printing record earnings and startups wielding their GPUs as a competitive edge. As the US tightens its restrictions on trade restrictions on China and mobilizes its allies in the chip wars, NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD have started to sell export-control proof chips at scale.
>   - **GenAI saves the VC world**, as amid a slump in tech valuations, AI startups focused on generative AI applications (including video, text, and coding), raised over $18 billion from VC and corporate investors.
>   - **The safety debate has exploded into the mainstream**, prompting action from governments and regulators around the world. However, this flurry of activity conceals profound divisions within the AI community and a lack of concrete progress towards global governance, as governments around the world pursue conflicting approaches.
>   - **Challenges mount in evaluating state of the art models**, as standard LLMs often struggle with robustness. Considering the stakes, as “vibes-based” approach isn’t good enough.
