> Introducing Coral NPU, a full-stack, open-source platform designed to address the core performance, fragmentation, and privacy challenges that limit powerful, always-on AI with low-power edge devices and wearables.

> To move from the cloud to personal devices, we must solve three critical problems:  
> <br>
> - The performance gap: Complex, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models demand more compute, far exceeding the limited power, thermal, and memory budgets of an edge device.
> - The fragmentation tax: Compiling and optimizing ML models for a diverse landscape of proprietary processors is difficult and costly, hindering consistent performance across devices.
> - The user trust deficit: To be truly helpful, personal AI must prioritize the privacy and security of personal data and context.
