> ...as comments sections grew, they became less useful and more prone to toxic, hateful and counter-deliberative discussions...comments are great when the topic of blogs is more narrow, and the blogger is directly engaged. But in the context of broad and widely popular communities, they had the capability to fester.

> As the web continued to grow, the issue grew. Without dedicated moderation, which many publications did try, comments sections became discordant and a liability...Washington Post was one of the first publications to remove comments, citing a lack of civility.

For sites that can manage comments, it is done through careful moderation and [clear rules](https://www.metafilter.com/content_policy.mefi). But most major publications and platforms have simply opted out.
