> We’re making it easier for people to experience the benefits of AI without needing to sign up.

> We may use what you provide to ChatGPT to improve our models for everyone. If you’d like, you can turn this off through your Settings - whether you create an account or not. 

> We’ve also introduced additional content safeguards for this experience, such as blocking prompts and generations in a wider range of categories.
