> Today, we’re publicly releasing the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) model, a crucial step in [advancing machine intelligence](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf) with a more grounded understanding of the world.

> This early example of a physical world model excels at detecting and understanding highly detailed interactions between objects.

> In the spirit of responsible open science, we’re releasing this model under a Creative Commons NonCommercial license for researchers to further explore.
