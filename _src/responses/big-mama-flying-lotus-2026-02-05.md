> Flying Lotus fans rejoice, today the famed electronic auteur announces BIG MAMA, a brand new EP coming out on 6th of March.  
> <br>
> BIG MAMA captures Ellison in a moment of spontaneous, unbridled momentum. Densely packed with disparate sounds, rhythms, and effects, the EP delivers what he describes as “experimental, maximalist, hyperfast, electronic burst of energy”, packing seven dynamic tracks into a single continuous composition in which every bar is unique, containing no loops throughout.  
> <br>
> “I wanted it to feel like being shot out of a cannon, just explosive, unpredictable energy,” he explains. “Like a fuckin’ computer gone awry. Like a machine that had just lost its mind.”  

New FlyLo album. Can't wait!
