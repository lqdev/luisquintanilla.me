> Today, Google announced the [Agent Payments Protocol](http://goo.gle/ap2) (AP2), an open protocol developed with leading payments and technology companies to securely initiate and transact agent-led payments across platforms. The protocol can be used as an extension of the [Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/) and Model Context Protocol (MCP). In concert with industry rules and standards, it establishes a payment-agnostic framework for users, merchants, and payments providers to transact with confidence across all types of payment methods.
