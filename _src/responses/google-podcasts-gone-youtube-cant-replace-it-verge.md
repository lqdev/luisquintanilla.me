Good article. I felt this way when Google Reader and a few other services were shut down.

That being said, this is kind of a good thing. 

> Luckily, there are plenty of good podcast apps out there, like Pocket Casts, Overcast, Antennapod, and even Apple Podcasts.

This line basically says it all. Podcasts, like blogging, continue to be an open ecosystem and where the saying,"wherever you get your podcasts", is still going strong.
