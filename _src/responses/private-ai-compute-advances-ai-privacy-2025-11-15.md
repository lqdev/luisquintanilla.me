> Today, we’re taking the next step in building helpful experiences that keep users safe with Private AI Compute in the cloud, a new AI processing platform that combines our most capable Gemini models from the cloud with the same security and privacy assurances you expect from on-device processing. It's part of our ongoing commitment to deliver AI with safety and responsibility at the core.

> Private AI Compute is built on a multi-layered system that is designed from the ground up around core security and privacy principles:  
> <br>
> - **One integrated Google tech stack:** Private AI Compute runs on one seamless Google stack powered by our own custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). World-class privacy and security is integrated into this architecture with [Titanium](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/titanium-underpins-googles-workload-optimized-infrastructure?e=48754805) Intelligence Enclaves (TIE). This design enables Google AI features to use our most capable and intelligent [Gemini models in the cloud](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/), with our high standards for privacy and the same in-house computing infrastructure you already rely on for Gmail and Search.
> - **No access:** Remote attestation and encryption are used to connect your device to the hardware-secured sealed cloud environment, allowing Gemini models to securely process your data within a specialized, protected space. This ensures sensitive data processed by Private AI Compute remains accessible only to you and no one else, not even Google.
