> Today, we release the FLUX.2 [klein] model family, our fastest image models to date. FLUX.2 [klein] unifies generation and editing in a single compact architecture, delivering state-of-the-art quality with end-to-end inference as low as under a second. Built for applications that require real-time image generation without sacrificing quality, and runs on consumer hardware with as little as 13GB VRAM.
