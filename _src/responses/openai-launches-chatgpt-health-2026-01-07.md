> ChatGPT Health is a sandboxed tab within ChatGPT that’s designed for users to ask their health-related questions in what it describes as a more secure and personalized environment, with a separate chat history and memory feature than the rest of ChatGPT. The company is encouraging users to connect their personal medical records and wellness apps, such as Apple Health, Peloton, MyFitnessPal,Weight Watchers, and Function, “to get more personalized, grounded responses to their questions.” It suggests connecting medical records so that ChatGPT can analyze lab results, visit summaries, and clinical history

At a high level, more personalized plans and suggestions beyond, "eat more veggies and exercise more", are something to aim toward. However, privacy and security need to be proritized. Even if you were to trust OpenAI is doing the right thing here, can you say the same if someone else were to buy the company? 23andMe can serve as an example here.
