> Mistral Large is our flagship model, with top-tier reasoning capacities. It is also available on Azure.

> Mistral Large comes with new capabilities and strengths:  
> <br>
>   - It is natively fluent in English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian, with a nuanced understanding of grammar and cultural context.  
> <br>
>   - Its 32K tokens context window allows precise information recall from large documents.  
> <br>
>   - Its precise instruction-following enables developers to design their moderation policies – we used it to set up the system-level moderation of le Chat.  
> <br>
>   - It is natively capable of function calling. This, along with constrained output mode, implemented on la Plateforme, enables application development and tech stack modernisation at scale.  

> At Mistral, our mission is to make frontier AI ubiquitous. This is why we’re announcing today that we’re bringing our open and commercial models to Azure.
