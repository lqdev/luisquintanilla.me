> ...the magazine is not 'dead'. Much like the podcast, it is simply on a hiatus. Many people falsely report online that the podcast and magazine are officially never coming back, which is contradictory to my [previous post](https://inteltechniques.com/blog/2023/11/20/my-irish-exit/). The reason there have been no issues of the magazine is simply a lack of submissions.

> The magazine is a community-driven product. Without the community driving it, it will go nowhere. If you would like to submit an article, please email it to staff@unredactedmagazine.com.

> Sponsors are lined up to pay the costs and keep the content free, but there lies other problems. We received constant complaints about having sponsors. Most readers demanded free content without ads, which is unrealistic.

> We have considered a small fee per issue, but the credit card fraud which comes with that is an even bigger issue. What is the solution? I do not know yet. If the articles pour in, I will figure it out.
