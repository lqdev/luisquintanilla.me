> I don’t know about you, but to me, the internet ≠ social media.

Spot on

> Imagine a social platform that’s not controlled by a single billionaire. A platform that’s not powered by a closed-source algorithm. [Usernames are unique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name), the [underlying protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) powering it is flexible and very robust. Your [profile page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website) is infinitely customizable, and no two profiles need to look the same. It supports [DMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) and [chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC). A platform where you can post videos, photos, audio, 3D content, you name it, and where you can [follow other people’s pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and be sure that no algorithm will hide that content from you. A platform that's not censored or moderated by arbitrary rules set by a Silicon Valley billionaire.

Maybe one day.
