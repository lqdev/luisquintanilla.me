> Tumblr is introducing a new Community feature — in-app groups organized by topic or interest.

> Communities are similar to subreddits or Facebook groups and had previously been in beta.

Given recent announcements like [Tumblr replatforming on top of WordPress](/responses/shipping-wordpress-tumblr/) and [WordPress adding support for ActivityPub](/responses/wordpress-activitypub-plugin/), I could see communities becoming not only an alternative to Reddit, but also Lemmy in the Fediverse.
