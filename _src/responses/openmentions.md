> OpenMentions is a project designed to use Webmentions and ActivityPub for topical content discovery. The site is organised along the lines of a hierarchy of topics going from broad to fine. This we call OpenTopic â€“ the idea being that many sites could host the full collection of topics so that the loss of any one site is not the loss of all topics.  
> <br>
> The intention is that this site should own nothing and that topic hierarchies are organic and discoverable.
