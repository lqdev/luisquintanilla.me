> Being of the Xennial generation, with the bad back to prove it, I can reflect on my youthful days in the mid-1980's, when we had 4 channels and children’s TV came on for but a couple of hours each day. There wasn't any arguments because there wasn't any choice to argue over, until VCRs started to catch on. This was the seed of an idea to try to replicate that experience for my kids, limiting access to on-demand TV and introducing a channel of parent approved programming.

> Using DizqueTV I create my first channel "Kid's Retro TV", this plays a range of older programming from the late 80's and 90's that my kids really enjoy a lot and benefit from having been made before kids programming was distilled to toxic levels of stimulating sounds and colours. Next was the "kids Movie Channel" (I'm creative I am), and finally the "Bedtime Channel", this is one which starts at 5pm and finishes at 8pm, after the retro channel is configured to shut down. It has a more limited set of programs that are low-stimulation so they don't disrupt the winding down process before bed.

This is a cool project.
