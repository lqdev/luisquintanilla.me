> Shown off at CES 2025 is VLC's upcoming automatic subtitling feature, which is local in nature, running entirely on a user's machine without needing to connect to some distant server.  
> <br>
> According to Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the creator and lead developer of VLC, this new feature is powered by open source AI models, which carry out subtitle generation tasks in two stages.  
> <br>
> One aspect is automatic generation of subtitles from the video, and the other is translation of those subtitles into over 100 languages.  

> Unfortunately, there's no word on when this feature will be arriving on VLC.
