> oday, we are excited to advance our mission by open sourcing DBRX, a general purpose large language model (LLM) built by our Mosaic Research team that outperforms all established open source models on standard benchmarks. We believe that pushing the boundary of open source models enables generative AI for all enterprises that is customizable and transparent.

> We are excited about DBRX for three distinct reasons. First, it handily beats open source models, such as, LLaMA2-70B, Mixtral, and Grok-1 on language understanding, programming, math, and logic...  
> <br>
> Second, DBRX beats GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks...  
> <br>
> Third, DBRX is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model built on the MegaBlocks research and open source project, making the model extremely fast in terms of tokens/second.
