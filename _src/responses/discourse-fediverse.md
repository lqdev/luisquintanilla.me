> Two years ago, we started working on a plugin that brings Discourse and the Fediverse closer together. Discourse communities are online spaces that facilitate open collaboration and communication. The Fediverse offers ways to expand the reach of Discourse communities and help them build bridges with people active in other spaces, all while keeping the conversation civil, meaningful and focused. This post will describe how the ActivityPub plugin works and how you can enable your Discourse community to connect with other communities or Fediverse users.
