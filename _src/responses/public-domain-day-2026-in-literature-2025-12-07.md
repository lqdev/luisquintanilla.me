> On January 1, 2026, books published in 1930 enter the U.S. public domain. 

> Books by [William Faulkner](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner), [Franz Kafka](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/franz-kafka), [Agatha Christie](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/agatha-christie), and [Langston Hughes](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/langston-hughes) enter the U.S. public domain. In addition, [The Maltese Falcon](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dashiell-hammett/the-maltese-falcon), perhaps the best-known noir book—and film—of all time, and books by [Evelyn Waugh](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/evelyn-waugh), [Dorothy L. Sayers](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/dorothy-l-sayers), and more, become free for anyone in the U.S. to read, use, and re-use.
