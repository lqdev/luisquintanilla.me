I'm guilty of owning way too many domains but this short-hand (lqdev.me) and other permadomain (luisquintanilla.me) are the ones I use mostly. 

A potential happy medium I've seen is using subdomains (i.e. project.lqdev.me). 

[Jim Nielsen has great examples](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2018/pathnames-to-subdomains/) of how he's doing that today. Though that's an older post, he also addressed it most recently in the post [Domain Sins of My Youth](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/domain-sins-of-my-youth/). 

That somehow feels better than the URL you get when you use free hosting like GitHub Pages. As a bonus, it's already tied to your identity (if using your personal domain). Also, you save some money. 

There's a few ways I practice this today. In addition to the previously mentioned domains, I also own lqdev.tech. Services and projects I host live there. 

For example:

- Mastodon Instance (toot.lqdev.tech)
- Matrix server (matrix.lqdev.tech)
- Webmentions service (webmentions.lqdev.tech)

So far it's been working well.
