> Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the art open models built from research and technology used to create Google Gemini models. They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants.

> This is the official PyTorch implementation of Gemma models. We provide model and inference implementations using both PyTorch and PyTorch/XLA, and support running inference on CPU, GPU and TPU.
