> Algorithm fatigue has been building for some time. 

> Gen Z might be less likely to discover a new artist they love than some older generations. But they’re also leading a resurgence in college radio. Terrestrial radio once seemed like a dying format, but many schools now report they don’t have enough time slots to accommodate all the aspiring DJs.

> Even the iPod is enjoying a renaissance. Classic iPods fetch hundreds of dollars on eBay, and an entire subculture, albeit small, has arisen around modding them to extend battery life, increase storage, and add modern conveniences like Bluetooth and USB-C.

> At this stage, anti-algorithm is itself an entire genre of content. Particularly on YouTube, where creators make videos about ditching streaming, stopping doomscrolling, and how the algorithm has flattened culture.

It's not either, or. Human curation and algorithms can coexist. The problem is end users are seldom given a choice.
