> Feta is a Matrix server distribution for the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4.

This looks like a great project to get started with self-hosting and join the Matrix network. Having something similar for the fediverse would be great as well. I've hosted Matrix and Mastodon servers on a Raspberry Pi before so I know it's up to the task.
