## Development

> Python and SQL remain the two most common programming skills for data scientists

> VSCode is now used by over 50% of working data scientists

Notebooks are a popular environment as well. 

> Colab notebooks are the most popular cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment

Makes sense especially since Kaggle is owned by Google. 

## Machine Learning

> Kaggle DS & ML Survey 2022 Scikit-learn is the most popular ML framework while PyTorch has been growing steadily year-over-year

LightGBM, XGBoost are also among the top frameworks.  

> Transformer architectures are becoming more popular for deep learning models (both image and text data)

## Cloud computing

> All major cloud computing providers saw strong year over year growth in 2022

> Specialized hardware like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) is gaining initial traction with Kaggle data scientists
