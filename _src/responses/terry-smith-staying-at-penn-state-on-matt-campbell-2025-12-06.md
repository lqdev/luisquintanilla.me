> Penn State and Matt Campbell reportedly came to an agreement earlier tonight, with the now former Iowa State head coach headed to Happy Valley on an eight-year deal. The first order of business for Campbell if you asked ANY Penn State fan was: ask and/or beg Terry Smith to stay at Penn State. Well, I’m not sure on the “ask” or “beg” part, but according to multiple reports (first by Audrey Snyder), Terry isn’t going freaking anywhere.

Love this. Happy for Terry.
