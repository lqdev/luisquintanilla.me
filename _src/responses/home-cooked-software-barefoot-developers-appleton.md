> The emerging golden age of home-cooked software, barefoot developers, and why the local-first community should help build it

> This is a talk I presented Local-first Conference in Berlin, May 2024. It's specifically directed at the local-first
community, but its relevant to anyone involved in building software.  
> </br>
> For the last ~year I've been keeping a close eye on how language models capabilities meaningfully change the speed, ease, and accessibility of software development. The slightly bold theory I put forward in this talk is that we're on a verge of a golden age of local, home-cooked software and a new kind of developer â€“ what I've called the barefoot developer.
