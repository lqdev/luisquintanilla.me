Great session on Tensors in .NET by [Tanner](https://bsky.app/profile/tannergooding.bsky.social)

Tensors are the foundational data structure powering man AI workloads today. 

Introduced in .NET 9, [Tensors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview#tensort) builds on top of earlier work like [TensorPrimitives](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-ml-net-3-0/#tensor-primitives-integration), [hardware intrinsics](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/hardware-intrinsics-in-net-core/), and [generic math](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/generics/math).
