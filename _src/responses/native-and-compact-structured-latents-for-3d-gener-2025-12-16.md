> "TRELLIS.2 is a state-of-the-art large 3D generative model (4B parameters) designed for high-fidelity image-to-3D generation. It leverages a novel "field-free" sparse voxel structure termed O-Voxel to reconstruct and generate arbitrary 3D assets with complex topologies, sharp features, and full PBR materials."
