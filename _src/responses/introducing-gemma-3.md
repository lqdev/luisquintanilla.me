> Today, we're introducing Gemma 3, a collection of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the same research and technology that powers our Gemini 2.0 models. These are our most advanced, portable and responsibly developed open models yet. They are designed to run fast, directly on devices — from phones and laptops to workstations — helping developers create AI applications, wherever people need them. Gemma 3 comes in a range of sizes (1B, 4B, 12B and 27B), allowing you to choose the best model for your specific hardware and performance needs.

> Build with the world's best single-accelerator model: Gemma 3 delivers state-of-the-art performance for its size, outperforming Llama3-405B, DeepSeek-V3 and o3-mini in preliminary human preference evaluations on LMArena’s leaderboard. This helps you to **create engaging user experiences that can fit on a single GPU or TPU host.**

> Create AI with **advanced text and visual reasoning capabilities**: Easily build applications that analyze images, text, and short videos, opening up new possibilities for interactive and intelligent applications.

> Handle complex tasks with an expanded context window: Gemma 3 offers a **128k-token context window** to let your applications process and understand vast amounts of information.

> Create AI-driven workflows using function calling: **Gemma 3 supports function calling and structured output** to help you automate tasks and build agentic experiences.
