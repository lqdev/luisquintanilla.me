> Despite the odds, cassette tapes are making a comeback. And one family-owned company in Springfield, Missouri is a leader in the revival.

Hopefully this also means that players are also making a comeback because you need something to play them on. Having visited a museum recently full of old radio recordings on cassette tapes, I was sad to find out I couldn't listen to them because the tape player was broken. It's hard enough finding a decent MP3 player, I'm sure it must be just as hard if not harder finding a tape player.
