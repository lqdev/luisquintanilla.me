That's unfortunate. Having Tumblr as your frontend for posting and curating feeds, with WordPress as the backend and integrated with decentralized networks like the Fediverse for distribution would've been amazing. It sounds like Tumblr is still strategic to Automattic and as more people move away from the centralized social platforms and towards their own corners of the internet, having these differente building blocks in place will be even more important.
