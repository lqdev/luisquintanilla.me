Since Joe Rogan went exclusive with Spotify, I maybe listened to a handful of episodes. The main reason for it is, I don't use Spotify to listen to podcasts. Periodically, I'd scroll through the feed to see if he had any intereting guests on. As part of his new contract, the podcast is now available on other platforms. That means you can listen [wherever you get your podcasts](https://podbay.fm/p/the-joe-rogan-experience/about).
