> Microsoft is ending support for its Android subsystem in Windows 11 next year. The software giant first announced it was bringing Android apps to Windows 11 with Amazonâ€™s Appstore nearly three years ago, but this Windows Subsystem for Android will now be deprecated starting March 5th, 2025.

That's unfortunate considering the new lineup of ARM-based PCs expected later this year. It would've been nice to have a [mobile PC with 5G support](/responses/windows-12-mobile-concept/) that could run mobile apps for scenarios where there are no web / native PC apps.
