> Today, at KubeCon NA 2025, we’re focused on making Kubernetes the most open and scalable platform for AI agents, with the introduction of Agent Sandbox.

> At its core, Agent Sandbox is a new Kubernetes primitive built with the Kubernetes community that’s designed specifically for agent code execution and computer use, delivering the performance and scale needed for the next generation of agentic AI workloads. Foundationally built on gVisor with additional support for Kata Containers for runtime isolation, Agent Sandbox provides a secure boundary to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities that could lead to data loss, exfiltration or damage to production systems.
