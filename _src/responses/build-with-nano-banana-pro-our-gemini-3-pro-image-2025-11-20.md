> "Today, we’re releasing Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image), a higher-fidelity model built on Gemini 3 Pro for developers to access studio-quality image generation. This follows our release of Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) just a few months ago. Since then, we’ve loved seeing the community put its key features to work — from character consistency to photo restoration, and even using its capabilities to make local edits in an infinite canvas."
