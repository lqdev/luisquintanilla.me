> ...my blog has become a central hub for almost everything I write online, including nearly all my social media posts, links to my published work on other sites, and the occasional freestanding blog post. While this approach has a few trade-offs, I feel better about posting in the first place knowing that I’m doing it on my own terms.

> There’s also just something deeply satisfying about seeing a running feed of my own writing, on my own website, with my own design and presentation. A social network alone can’t replicate that, but the POSSE approach offers the best of both worlds.
