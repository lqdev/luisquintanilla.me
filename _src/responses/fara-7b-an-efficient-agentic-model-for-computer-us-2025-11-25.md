> Today, we are pleased to announce Fara-7B, our first agentic SLM designed specifically for computer use.  
> <br>
> Unlike traditional chat models that generate text-based responses, Computer Use Agent (CUA) models like Fara-7B leverage computer interfaces, such as a mouse and keyboard, to complete tasks on behalf of users. With only 7 billion parameters, Fara-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance within its size class and is competitive with larger, more resource-intensive agentic systems that depend on prompting multiple large models. Fara-7B’s small size now makes it possible to run CUA models directly on devices. This results in reduced latency and improved privacy, as user data remains local.

> Fara-7B is an experimental release, designed to invite hands-on exploration and feedback from the community. Users can build and test agentic experiences beyond pure research—automating everyday web tasks like filling out forms, searching for information, booking travel, or managing accounts. We recommend running Fara-7B in a sandboxed environment, monitoring its execution, and avoiding sensitive data or high-risk domains. Responsible use is essential as the model continues to evolve."
