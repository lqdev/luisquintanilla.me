> The Eye of the Sahara, or Guelb er Richat, is a massive eroded geological dome in the Sahara Desert. Once misinterpreted as an impact crater, modern geology reveals its formation through uplift and erosion over millions of years, exposing concentric rings of sedimentary and igneous rock.

Amazing photographs.
