> The "Agentic Fediverse" is the idea of a new kind of network federation, a complementary iteration on the concept of federation currently established with ActivityPub. It's an experiment and something that we in Muni Town are still trying to define more concretely.

## Tenets

> We are still working on defining the core tenets of the agentic fediverse, but here is what we have so far.  
> <br>
> An agentic fediverse is...  
> <br>
> 1. A fediverse of agents; agent-centric, as opposed to server-centric.  
> 2. Local-first; solve local problems for local people.  
> 3. Accessible by default; inaccessibility is a bug.  
> 4. Systematically consensual; architected on the basis of informed consent.
