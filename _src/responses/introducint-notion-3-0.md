> Here's the TL;DR:
> <br>
> Notion 3.0 is here: The biggest evolution of Notion yet, with Notion AI Agents at the center.  
> <br>
> Agents can do everything a human can do in Notion: Create docs, build databases, search across tools, and execute multi-step workflows.  
> <br>
> Personalize your Agent: Give your personal Agent custom instructions and context about how you workâ€”with some aesthetic flair.  
> <br>
> Custom Agents are coming: Soon, you'll go from one personal Agent to a full team of Custom Agents to automate different workflows.  
> <br>
> Plus more highly-requested features: Database row permissions, new AI connectors and additional MCP integrations are here!  

I'm not a Notion user, but the agents feature seems interesting.
