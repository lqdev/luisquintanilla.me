> Today, we are introducing Google Antigravity, our new agentic development platform. While the core is a familiar AI-powered IDE experience with the best of Google’s models, Antigravity is evolving the IDE towards an agent-first future with browser control capabilities, asynchronous interaction patterns, and an agent-first product form factor that together, enable agents to autonomously plan and execute complex, end-to-end software tasks.
