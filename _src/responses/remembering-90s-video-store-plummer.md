Reading this post and attached image brings back so many memories. 

I remember in the last few years of Blockbuster and early days of Netflix, for about $20/month you could rent unlimited movies (I think it was up to three at a time). 

If you binge watched them or weren't happy with the choices you made, you could just drive down to your local store, return them, and grab a new set of movies. 

Initially you had a return period, but towards the end, there were none so you basically got to keep some movies as long as you liked. 

Good times.
