> What if we flipped the model on its head?

> Instead of a single, all-knowing monolith, imagine a collaborative ecosystem where domain experts describe their data in natural language, providing context that empowers a network of intelligent, autonomous agents. Each agent becomes an expert in its domain — sales, marketing, logistics, finance — managing its own data by combining human-provided descriptions with its own skills to answer questions. This is the future of data platforms: a system that is agentic, distributed, and truly collaborative.

> I created a new open-source project, Da2a, to explore this paradigm. It’s a prototype that demonstrates how a multi-agent system can tackle complex data analysis by working together.
