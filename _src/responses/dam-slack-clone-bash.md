> suc provides Slack, Mattermost, etc.â€™s core features:
>  
>  Real-time, rich-text chat,  
>  File sharing,  
>  Fine-grained access control,  
>  Straightforward automation and integration with other tools,  
>  Data encryption in transit  
>  and optionally at rest,  
>  state-of-the-art user authentication.  
>  
> This paper shows how suc implements those features. suc stays small by leveraging the consistent and composable primitives offered by modern UNIX implementations
