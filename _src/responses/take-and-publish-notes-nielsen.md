> 99% of the time, this is how my note-taking process goes:
>
>    - Iâ€™m catching up on my RSS feed (on my phone in the Reeder app)
>    - I read something that strikes me as interesting, novel, or insightful.
>    - I copy/paste it as an blockquote into a new, plain-text note in iA writer.
>    - I copy/paste the link of the article into iA writer.
>    - I finish reading the article and copy/paste anything else in the article that strikes me.
>    - I add my own comments in the note as they pop into my head.
>    - I move on to the next article in my RSS feed.
>    - Repeat.

Kind of meta but somewhat similar process for me. To publish the different content found on my [response feed](/feed/responses/), I:

1. Go through articles on my RSS feed (NewsBlur on both desktop and mobile).
2. Copy URL and block quotes from article and paste them somewhere. When I have time like now, I create a post like this one, usually in VS Code. If I don't have time though, I've been experimenting with using a messaging app like Element and E-mail as a read-it-later service. At minimum, I create a message with the link and send it to myself for later review. Later on when I have time, I create the post with additional comments and content from the article.
3. (Optional) Add some of my own comments.
5. Publish the notes.
4. Repeat.
