> Thoughts I jotted down on Mastodon:  
> <br>
> 1) Blogs are newsletters that don’t require subscriptions.  
> <br>
> 2) Blogrolls are lists of blogs.  
> <br>
> 3) Both require the lowest possible cognitive and economic overhead.  
> <br>
> 4) That’s why they are coming back.  
> <br>
> I know, they never left. But you get my point.
