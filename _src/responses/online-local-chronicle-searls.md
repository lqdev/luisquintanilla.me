Nice project. Unfortunately, it's rare you get local news. I like publications / websites like [Hoboken Girl](https://www.hobokengirl.com/) and [Block Club Chicago](https://blockclubchicago.org/). I wish there were more of them in more cities and towns. I know they're there in some forms like Facebook Groups. Even better, it'd be great to have the websites for these publications be the main source of truth that then syndicated their content to the various platforms out there.
