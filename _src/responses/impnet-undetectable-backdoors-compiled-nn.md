> ...backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages.

> some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge.

> machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification.
