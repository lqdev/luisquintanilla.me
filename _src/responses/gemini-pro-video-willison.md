> I’ve been playing with Gemini Pro 1.5 for a few days, and I think the most exciting feature isn’t so much the token count... it’s the ability to use video as an input.

> The ability to extract structured content from text is already one of the most exciting use-cases for LLMs. GPT-4 Video and LLaVA expanded that to images. And now Gemini Pro 1.5 expands that to video.

> The ability to analyze video like this feels SO powerful. Being able to take a 20 second video of a bookshelf and get back a JSON array of those books is just the first thing I thought to try.

> ...as always with modern AI, there are still plenty of challenges to overcome...But this really does feel like another one of those glimpses of a future that’s suddenly far closer then I expected it to be.
