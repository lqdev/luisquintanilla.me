[Comparison of MCP and ANP: What Kind of Communication Protocol Do Agents Need?](https://agent-network-protocol.com/blogs/posts/mcp-anp-comparison.html)

> MCP and ANP differ significantly in protocol architecture, identity authentication, and information organization.  
> <br>
> - MCP is a typical Client-Server (CS) architecture, while **ANP is a typical Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture**.
> - MCP's identity authentication is based on the OAuth standard, facilitating client access to current internet resources. **ANP's identity authentication is based on the W3C DID standard**, focusing on cross-platform interoperability among agents, enabling seamless connectivity.
> - MCP organizes information using JSON-RPC technology, essentially API calls. **ANP uses semantic web Linked-Data technology** to build a data network that is easily accessible and understandable by AI.


> ANP is agent-centric, where each agent has equal status, forming a decentralized agent collaboration network.
