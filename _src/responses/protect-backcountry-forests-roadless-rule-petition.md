> For nearly 25 years, the Roadless Rule protected nearly one-third of our federal forestlands from major logging operations and oil-and-gas drilling. While nearly half of U.S. federal forest lands are open to these industries, the areas protected by the Roadless Rule are home to massive old-growth carbon sinks, habitats for vulnerable fish and wildlife, migratory corridors for game species and millennia-old cultural landscapes for Indigenous communities. They are beloved destinations for climbers, hikers, mountain bikers, paddlers, backcountry skiers and more and act as critical sources of clean drinking water for over 60 million people in 33 states.But the U.S. Department of Agriculture wants to end the Roadless Rule’s protections across nearly 45 million acres of the National Forest System. Unless we act now, we will lose protections for precious backcountry forestlands. Add your voice and tell the Department of Agriculture to reverse course before it’s too late.
