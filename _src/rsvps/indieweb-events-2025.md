This is a sample post demonstrating how to use RSVP custom blocks to respond to event invitations. RSVPs are an important part of the IndieWeb ecosystem, allowing you to publicly indicate your attendance plans while maintaining ownership of your data.

## About RSVP Posts

RSVP posts are a simple but powerful way to:

- Let event organizers know you're coming
- Share your event plans with your readers
- Maintain a personal calendar of events on your own site
- Support the IndieWeb principle of owning your data

Each RSVP includes:
- The event name and URL
- Your response status (yes, no, maybe, or interested)
- Optional event details like date and location
- Optional notes with additional context

For more information about RSVPs and other IndieWeb post types, check out [IndieWeb.org](https://indieweb.org/rsvp).
