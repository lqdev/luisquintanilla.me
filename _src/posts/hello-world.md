Welcome to my personal blog. This will be a blog post for documenting my learning process as well as sharing projects and ideas I come across. I often find myself doing things, researching how to do them and completing a task. A few weeks/months later I might have to do something similar and have to go through the process again. Using this blog will help me keep me reference that knowledge.
