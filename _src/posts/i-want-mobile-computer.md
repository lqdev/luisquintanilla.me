I've been reminiscing about my Surface Duo while using my ARM-based PC. I wish I could have the Surface Duo form factor with the computing capabilities and battery life of my ARM PC. What if we could marry the best of both worlds? 

The cancelled [Surface Neo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrR5KApQnsg) hinted at this future. It was a small form factor device that's a full PC with amazing battery life and always-on connectivity.

I don't want a phone that can do some computing tasks. I want a computer that can make phone calls and send text messages. And even text messages are optional when I can just use messaging apps. 

## Why Current Solutions Fall Short

### Mobile platforms aren't real computers

Android, despite its openness, remains fundamentally limited. Even with tools like Termux, you're still working within a sandbox rather than having true computing freedom.

### Gaming handhelds prove the concept but miss the mark

The Steam Deck and similar devices demonstrate that full PCs can exist in small form factors. However, they're optimized for AAA gaming, which demands power-hungry hardware and sacrifices battery life. But do we really need that level of performance for daily computing?

Consider what most people actually do: access the web, read news, scroll through feeds, listen to music, connect with others, create content, view and edit documents. Typically, these tasks don't require gaming-grade hardware. Apple has proven that mobile processors can handle intensive creative work like photo and video editing. [PewDiePie even self-hosts using his Steam Deck](https://youtu.be/u_Lxkt50xOg?si=I6lhmVOcsJWvJj9T&t=652), showcasing the real computing power in these compact devices.

## Changing app landscape

Where we're going, we don't need traditional apps.

The web is becoming the universal app platform. Desktop applications increasingly use Electron frameworks, essentially running web technologies. The web is inherently cross-platform, and as long as you can run a modern browser, you can run the apps that matter.

Yes, your current phone can't run Docker, VS Code, or full Photoshop. But my ARM Windows PC can. Pair it with a SIM card, and now you also get the benefits of always-on connectivity.

Add AI and agents to the picture and now you have a radically and more natural interface to access information, express intent, and take action on your computing device. 

## What about cost

I've seen current foldable phones cost anywhere from $1,500-[$3,500](https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/heres-how-much-the-samsung-tri-fold-could-cost-though-you-probably-wont-get-chance-to-buy-it). I didn't even pay $800 for my HP ARM PC, and even at $1,000-$1,500, it's significantly more capable than any phone.

I'm willing to pay computer prices for a computer. I'm not willing to pay computer prices for a device with limited functionality.

## My ideal form factor

My ideal pocket computer would be:

- **Foldable dual-screen design** (i.e. Surface Neo) - fits in a small sling bag or purse
- **Dual USB-C ports** - one for charging, one for peripherals
- **Multiple operating modes** - single screen for mobile use, dual screen for maximum real estate
- **Full docking capability** - when connected to external displays, the device becomes a secondary screen while powering your full desktop setup

Whether I'm on the go or at my desk, I'd have the same complete computing environment. 

## We have all the pieces

ARM processors have matured, battery technology has improved, and always-on connectivity is standard. The technology exists today to build this device. We just need someone to actually make it. Whoever does, I'll be one of the first in line to buy it.
