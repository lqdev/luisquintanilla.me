DISCLAIMER: AI was used to help me organize and improve the flow of this post. Ideas and thoughts expressed are my own. 

Lately I’ve noticed across a lot of different feeds people shifting away from Discord.

A while back I wrote a post about [alternatives to WhatsApp](/posts/alternatives-to-whatsapp/), and in some ways this post feels similar. I’m not sure what the core motivation for migrating from Discord is at this time. Maybe it’s the [imminent IPO](/responses/discord-quietly-files-for-us-ipo-2026-01-09/). Maybe it’s the [new age verification policy](https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally). In any case, it’s encouraging to see people at least looking for alternatives. Preferably ones that are open-source and allow self-hosting.

I grew up with IRC and AOL Instant Messenger, so it’s possible I’m just old and don’t really get Discord. But in many communities I’m part of, Discord is effectively being used as a forum. And as a forum replacement, it’s not great. Even with Threads, it feels subpar.

To be fair, I have similar criticisms of Slack and Teams.

Real-time chat moves fast. Too fast most of the time. That doesn’t mean it useless. It works well for scheduled events, live collaboration, or situations where everyone shares the same context at the same time. Gaming, which was its original use case, is a perfect example where real-time matters. But when conversations stretch over days, or when you want knowledge to accumulate instead of disappearing into scrollback, chat starts working against you.

When it comes to real-time group chat and chat rooms, I’m still a fan of [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). It's end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), you can self-host, and you can federate. I really value that combination. Federation has tradeoffs, especially if you’re maintaining your own instance. Even so, it remains one of the better options if you actually need synchronous communication.

Forums are a different category.

For forums, I think [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is by far the best option right now. A few reasons:

* It’s [open-source](https://discourse.org/open-source)
* You can [self-host](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/main/docs/INSTALL-cloud.md)
* It’s used by [well-known communities](https://discover.discourse.com/) like OpenAI, Spotify, NixOS, TWiT, and many others
* Strong [RSS support](https://meta.discourse.org/t/finding-discourse-rss-feeds/264134?tl=en)
* [Fediverse friendly](https://blog.discourse.org/2025/04/discourse-and-the-fediverse/)
* Built-in [real-time chat](https://www.discourse.org/chat), which I haven’t personally used but it’s there if you need it
* And [a lot more features](https://www.discourse.org/features) beyond that

As folks migrate, whether you’re a community member or running an instance, I don’t think the main story is the migration itself.

It’s more about using the right tool for the job.

Real-time chat is great when you actually need more synchronous communication. Forums are better when conversations need to stick around, be searchable, and grow over time. A lot of the friction I see comes from trying to make one behave like the other.

The other piece, at least for me, is control. When platform priorities shift, or incentives change, it’s easier to adapt if you’re not completely locked in. Self-hosting isn’t for everyone, but having that option changes the dynamic.

[Communities aren’t fungible](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/communities-are-not-fungible/). The tools they’re built on shape how they feel and how they evolve. That’s probably the part that matters most.

P.S. The recommendations in this post are purely anectodal and based on my experiene with the various platforms. For a more comprehensive analysis of the various Discord alterntives, check out the following resources:
