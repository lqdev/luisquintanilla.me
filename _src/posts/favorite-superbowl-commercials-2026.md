I didn't get a chance to watch the Super Bowl, but earlier today I caught up with the commercials. Here are my favorites.

## Instacart

I like Ben Stillers work, but I find the characters he plays in Heavyweights and Dodgeball some of the funniest. That's why I couldn't stop laughing at the Instacart commercial.

## State Farm

Similarly, I like the work of Danny McBride and Keegan-Michael Key, so I found the State Farm Commercial hilarious.

## Squarespace

Emma Stone, IndieWeb spokeperson? I liked Squarespace's message to own your domain, identity, and content on the web. It's supposed to be funny but so true and important.

## Pepsi

This was a fun dig at Coca Cola. I'm still team Coca Cola but this was funny.

## Redfin & Rocket Mortgage

We all need a neighbor.
