## About Collections

These collections follow some of the principles of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and traditional web discovery. Each collection:

- Provides multiple subscription formats (RSS and OPML)
- Maintains human-readable pages for browsing
- Links directly to source websites and feeds
- Updates regularly with new discoveries

Part of the broader movement toward decentralized, human-curated discovery in contrast to algorithmic feeds.
