# In Real Life (IRL) Stack

Devices, apps, and services I use day-to-day.

## Computing

- [Schok Classic](https://schokgear.com/) - Daily driver. It has all the basics and a little extra since it's Android Open Source Project (AOSP) based.
- [Surface Go](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/devices/surface-go/tech-specs)
- [Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/surface/devices/surface-duo?activetab=overview)
- [Pinebook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/)
- [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) - Self-hosting server

- [Osprey Farpoint Travel Pack 55](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/farpoint-travel-pack-55-FARPNT55.html) - I don't use the large backpack much but the daypack is the main backpack I use for day hikes.

## Photography & Video

- [Logitech C920S Pro HD Webcam](https://www.logitech.com/products/webcams/c920s-pro-hd-webcam.960-001257.html) - Webcam for video calls & streaming

- [Akaso Brave 7](https://www.akasotech.com/brave-7) - Action cam. I usually use it to record outdoor trips. It's also compact enough for every day carry to supplement my phone's camera.

## Audio

## Operating Systems

## Applications

### Audio

- [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/) - Podcasts on Android
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) - Exclusively for music. It would probably be easier to use it for both music and podcasts but for some odd reason, I like managing music & podcasts separately.
- [MusicBee](https://getmusicbee.com/) - Manage podcasts on Windows & transfer them to my MP3 player.

### Communication

- [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) - Chat
- [Jami](https://jami.net/) - Chat

- [Slack](https://slack.com/) - Chat
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) - Chat
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) - Audio & Video calling

### Feed Reader & News

- [Newsblur](https://newsblur.com/) - If it has an RSS feed, it's here. Blogs, news sites, YouTube channels, podcasts, etc. I use NewsBlur as the one place to manage my RSS feeds. I also have these RSS feeds in apps like AntennaPod & MusicBee for podcasts but NewsBlur is the source of truth in case I decide to switch podcast apps in the future. Also, NewsBlur provides you with an e-mail address so you can subscribe to e-mail newsletters.

### Maps & Navigation

- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
- [OSMAnd~](https://osmand.net/)
- [Here Maps](https://wego.here.com/)

### Notetaking

- [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app)
- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) - I really like authoring content in Markdown. Joplin lets me do that for notes while also giving me flexibility when it comes to syncing.
