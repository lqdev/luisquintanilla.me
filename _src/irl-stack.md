## Software

### Operating Systems

- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) - **Daily driver**
- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/)
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/)
- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
- [Android](https://www.blog.google/products/android/)

### Audio

- [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/) - Podcasts on Android
- [RadioDroid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.programmierecke.radiodroid2/) - Internet radio
- [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) - Listen to internet radio and podcasts on desktop.
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) - Exclusively for music. It would probably be easier to use it for both music and podcasts but for some odd reason, I like managing music & podcasts separately.

### Communication

- [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) - Chat
- [Jami](https://jami.net/) - Chat
- [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) - Video calling
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) - Chat
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) - Chat
- [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) - Audio & Video calling

### Feed Reader & News


- [NewsBlur](https://newsblur.com/) - If it has an RSS feed, it's here. Blogs, news sites, YouTube channels, podcasts, etc. I use NewsBlur as the one place to manage my RSS feeds. I also have these RSS feeds in apps like AntennaPod & MusicBee for podcasts but NewsBlur is the source of truth in case I decide to switch podcast apps in the future. Also, NewsBlur provides you with an e-mail address so you can subscribe to e-mail newsletters.
- [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) - Emacs feed reader. I use elfeed to read a slimmed down version of all the feeds I follow on NewsBlur. The feeds I follow on here are mainly the ones listed in my [blogroll](/feed/blogroll) and [podroll](/feed/podroll). 

### Maps & Navigation

- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
  - [OSMAnd~](https://osmand.net/) - Android app for OpenStreetMap
- [Here Maps](https://wego.here.com/) - Secondary map app. OpenStreetMap reverse geo-coding capabilities leave something to be desired, so Here Maps is handy then.

### Notetaking

- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) - **Daily driver**. I really like authoring content in Markdown. Joplin lets me do that for notes while also giving me flexibility when it comes to syncing.
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app)
