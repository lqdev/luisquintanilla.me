> Nantucket Lit™ is a free and open-source platform that allows writers to create and share high-quality e-books. These e-books can be read directly in a web brow­ser without needing special apps or devices. The platform avoids using AI or DRM. E-books are written in Shanty™, a markup language specifically designed for e-books. Shanty can also be used to produce EPUB files and paperback books.
