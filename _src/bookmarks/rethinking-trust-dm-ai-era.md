> This blog post is a part of a series exploring our research in privacy, security, and cryptography. For the previous post, see [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/research-trends-in-privacy-security-and-cryptography](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/research-trends-in-privacy-security-and-cryptography). While AI has the potential to massively increase productivity, this power can be used equally well for malicious purposes, for example, to automate the creation of sophisticated scam messages. In this post, we explore threats AI can pose for online communication ecosystems and outline a high-level approach to mitigating these threats.
