> SatCLIP trains location and image encoders via contrastive learning, by matching images to their corresponding locations. This is analogous to the CLIP approach, which matches images to their corresponding text. Through this process, the location encoder learns characteristics of a location, as represented by satellite imagery. For more details, check out our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17179).
