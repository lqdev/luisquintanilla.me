> The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting â€“ they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments...But streams only surface the Zeitgeisty ideas of the last 24 hours...Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time...The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.

> The Six Patterns of Gardening:
> 
> 1. Topography over Timelines - Gardens are organised around contextual relationships and associative links; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.
> 2. Continuous Growth - Gardens are never finished, they're constantly growing, evolving, and changing.
> 3. Imperfection & Learning in Public - Gardens are imperfect by design. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.
> 4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental - Gardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants.
> 5. Intercropping & Content Diversity - Gardens are not just a collection of interlinked words...Podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden.
> 6. Independent Ownership - Gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control... If you give it a bit of forethought, you can build your garden in a way that makes it easy to transfer and adapt. Platforms and technologies will inevitably change. Using old-school, reliable, and widely used web native formats like HTML/CSS is a safe bet.
