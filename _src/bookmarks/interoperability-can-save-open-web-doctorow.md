> In his new book [The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation](https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con), author [Cory Doctorow](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/cory-doctorow) presents a strong case for disrupting Big Tech. While the dominance of Internet platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Amazon is often taken for granted, Doctorow argues that these walled gardens are fenced in by legal structures, not feats of engineering. Doctorow proposes forcing interoperability—any given platform’s ability to interact with another—as a way to break down those walls and to make the Internet freer and more democratic.
