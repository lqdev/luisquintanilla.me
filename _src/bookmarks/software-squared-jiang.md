> A new generation of AIs that become increasingly general by producing their own training data

> We are currently at the cusp of transitioning from “learning from data” to “learning what data to learn from” as the central focus of AI research.

> If deep learning can be described as “Software 2.0”—software that programs itself based on example inputs/output pairs, then this promising, data-centric paradigm, in which software effectively improves itself by searching for its own training data, can be described as a kind of “Software²”. This paradigm inherits the benefits of Software 2.0 while improving on its core, data-bound weaknesses: While deep learning (Software 2.0) requires the programmer to manually provide training data for each new task, Software² recasts data as software that models or searches the world to produce its own, potentially unlimited, training tasks and data.
