> The "Staff Picks" are a monthly feature of the LibriVox homepage and news. Every month, 10 books from our catalog are chosen according to a theme and are displayed on our homepage. The main goal is to show the variety of audiobooks we are offering, and to help listeners find the hidden gems in our catalog.
