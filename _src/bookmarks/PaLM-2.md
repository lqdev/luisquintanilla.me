> PaLM 2 is our next generation large language model that builds on Google’s legacy of breakthrough research in machine learning and responsible AI.
> 
> It excels at advanced reasoning tasks, including code and math, classification and question answering, translation and multilingual proficiency, and natural language generation better than our previous state-of-the-art LLMs, including PaLM. It can accomplish these tasks because of the way it was built – bringing together compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture improvements.
> 
> PaLM 2 is grounded in Google’s approach to building and deploying AI responsibly. It was evaluated rigorously for its potential harms and biases, capabilities and downstream uses in research and in-product applications. It’s being used in other state-of-the-art models, like Med-PaLM 2 and Sec-PaLM, and is powering generative AI features and tools at Google, like Bard and the PaLM API.
