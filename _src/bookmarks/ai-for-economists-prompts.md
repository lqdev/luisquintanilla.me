> Example prompts are shown from six domains: ideation and feedback; writing; background research; coding; data analysis; and mathematical derivations.
> <br>
> The framework as well as some of the prompts and related notes come from Korinek, A. 2023. [“Generative AI for Economic Research: Use Cases and Implications for Economists“](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20231736), Journal of Economic Literature, 61 (4): 1281–1317.
