> One of Jami’s core features is its ability to function in emergency settings where internet access is severely limited or entirely cut off.

> ‌Unlike traditional messaging apps that rely on central servers to relay messages, Jami connects users peer to peer. This means each device acts as a node in a decentralized web, sending encrypted data directly to others, without any intermediary.

> In troubled times, staying connected is not a luxury. It is a necessity.‌‌It means ensuring safety, coordination, and the ability to call for help, share your location, and reach your loved ones.  
> <br>
> When official channels fail, direct communication helps share verified information, document events, and fight misinformation.  
> <br>
> It also defends our freedoms. Speaking freely, even under pressure, is essential to support, resist, and rebuild.  
> <br>
> Staying connected maintains solidarity and mental well-being. No one should face crisis alone.  
> <br>
> And above all, it keeps communities resilient, able to act and organize even in the darkest times.  
> <br>
> That is why tools like Jami, which operate without a central server or reliance on tech giants, are essential parts of a digital survival kit.
