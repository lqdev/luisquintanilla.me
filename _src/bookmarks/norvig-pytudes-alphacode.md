> Large language models have recently shown an ability to solve a variety of problems. In this notebook we consider programming problems (as solved by AlphaCode) and mathematics problems (as solved by Minerva). The questions we would like to get at are:
> 
>   - In the future, what role will these generative models play in assisting a programmer or mathematician?
>   - What will be a workflow that incorporates these models?
>   - How will other existing tools (such as programming languages) change to accomodate this workflow?
