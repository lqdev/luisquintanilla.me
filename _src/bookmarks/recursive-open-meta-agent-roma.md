> ROMA is a meta-agent framework that uses recursive hierarchical structures to solve complex problems. By breaking down tasks into parallelizable components, ROMA enables agents to tackle sophisticated reasoning challenges while maintaining transparency that makes context-engineering and iteration straightforward. The framework offers parallel problem solving where agents work simultaneously on different parts of complex tasks, transparent development with a clear structure for easy debugging, and proven performance demonstrated through our search agent's strong benchmark results. We've shown the framework's effectiveness, but this is just the beginning. As an open-source and extensible platform, ROMA is designed for community-driven development, allowing you to build and customize agents for your specific needs while benefiting from the collective improvements of the community.
