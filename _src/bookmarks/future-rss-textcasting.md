> Here’s the philosophy:
> 
>   - The goal is interop between social media apps and the features writers need.
>   - What we’re doing: Moving documents between networked apps. We need a set of common features in order for it to work.
>   - The features are motivated by the needs of writers. Not by programmers or social media company execs.

> It’s a proposal to build, using technologies we already have and understand very well, a very simple social media protocol that is completely agnostic about what editor you use to write your posts and what viewer you choose to read it. Writer/authors would have more control over styling, links, media enclosures, etc., and readers would have more control over how and where they consume it. It’s decentralized social media, but without the need to peer through ActivityPub or anybody else’s API and squeeze our toothpaste through its tubes.
