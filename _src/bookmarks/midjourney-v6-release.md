>   - Improved coherence, and model knowledge,
>   - Improved image prompting and remix mode,
>   - Minor text drawing ability (you must write your text in “quotations” and --style raw or lower --stylize values may help)
>   - /imagine a photo of the text "Hello World!" written with a marker on a sticky note --ar 16:9 --v 6
>   - Improved upscalers, with both 'subtle‘ and 'creative‘ modes (increases resolution by 2x) (you’ll see buttons for these under your images after clicking U1/U2/U3/U4)
