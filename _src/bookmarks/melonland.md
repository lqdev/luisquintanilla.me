> "You've arrived at MelonLand! This is a web project and online arts community that celebrates homepages, virtual worlds, the world-wide-web and the digital lives that all netizins share, here at the dawn of the digital age.  
> <br>
> This project has three goals:
> - To make the web; genuine, chaotic, timeless, individual and joyful
> - To provide knowledge and support to humans creating digital worlds
> - To promote websites and digital worlds as mediums of visual art. 
> <br>
> MelonLand is part of a wider movement sometimes called the web revival; to join, all you need to do is choose to engage with small handmade web projects next time you're online!"
