> We suggest these five principles as a starting place:  
> <br>
> 1. **Private**: In the era of AI, whoever controls the context holds the power. Users must stay in full control of their data and context. 
> 2. **Dedicated**: You must be able to trust that your software holds your best interest as its highest priority, without conflict of interest. 
> 3. **Plural**: No single entity should control the digital spaces we inhabit. Healthy ecosystems require distributed power, interoperability, and meaningful choice for participants. 
> 4. **Adaptable**: Software should be open-ended, able to meet the specific, context-dependent needs of each user. 
> 5. **Prosocial**: Technology should enable connection and coordination, helping us become better neighbors, collaborators, and stewards of shared spaces, both online and off.
