> AI agents are rapidly becoming essential for building intelligent applications, but creating robust, adaptable agents that scale across domains remains a challenge. Many existing frameworks struggle with brittleness, tool misuse, and failures when faced with complex workflows.  
> <br>
> CUGA (Configurable Generalist Agent) was designed to overcome these limitations. It's an open-source, AI Agent that combines flexibility, reliability, and ease of use for enterprise use cases. By abstracting orchestration complexity, CUGA empowers developers to focus on domain requirements rather than the internals of agent building.
