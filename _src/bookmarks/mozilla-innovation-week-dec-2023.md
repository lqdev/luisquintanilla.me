> Mozilla’s Innovation Week is a journey into the future of technology, where AI is not just a buzzword, but a reality we're actively shaping. Here, we're not just talking about innovation – we're living it through a series of AI-driven explorations.

> With that in mind, Innovation Week is more than a showcase. It's a platform for collaboration and inspiration. It's about bringing together ideas, people, and technology to pave the way for a more open and responsible future.
