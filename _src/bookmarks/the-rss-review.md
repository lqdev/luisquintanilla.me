> The RSS Review is just a little corner of the web trying to raise awareness about RSS and RSS feeds. By using RSS we, the people of the internet, do not have to wait for news, blog posts, podcasts, and articles to surface to us from search engines and social media. With RSS, you do not have to subscribe to news via email newsletters that will clutter your inbox.

> RSS is a way to begin taking the web back from big advertising who only wants to serve up ads based on your personal data. It is a way to get the content you want to read, when you want to read it.
