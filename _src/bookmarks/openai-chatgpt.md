> We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to [InstructGPT](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/), which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.
