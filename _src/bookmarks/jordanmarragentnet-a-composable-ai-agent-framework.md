> Agent.NET is an F#‑native authoring layer built on top of the Microsoft Agent Framework. MAF provides a powerful, low‑level foundation for building agent systems — durable state, orchestration primitives, tool execution, and a flexible runtime model.  
> <br>
> Agent.NET builds on those capabilities with a higher‑level, ergonomic workflow DSL designed for clarity, composability, and developer experience. Where MAF offers the essential building blocks, Agent.NET provides the expressive authoring model that makes agent workflows feel natural to write and reason about.

This is a cool project! Workflows as they were intended. The composition here looks more natural.
