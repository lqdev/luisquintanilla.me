> Openverse is a tool that allows openly licensed and public domain works to be discovered and used by everyone.

> Openverse searches across more than 800 million images and audio tracks from open APIs and the Common Crawl dataset. We aggregate works from multiple public repositories, and facilitate reuse through features like one-click attribution.

> Openverse is the successor to CC Search which was launched by Creative Commons in 2019
