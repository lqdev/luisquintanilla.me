## Description

> A cyberpunk thriller set in near-future Las Vegas...

> Detective Ada Byron is pumped to be assigned her first murder case–until she sees the crime scene. Someone has been killed exactly the same way as her father was seven years earlier. But, impossibly, he died using VR and the programmer responsible is still in prison. To see if this is a copycat or something more sinister, Ada must confront her father’s killer: the enigmatic Jazlin Switch. What she discovers will change the face of both the real world and the metaverse forever....

## Review

Really fun read. I was able to binge the audiobook in 2 days which is rare for me. While I wouldn't say the general themes covered are original, it still made for a good story. The general book is a cross-over between Blade Runner, Silence of the Lambs, Ready Player One, and House of Cards. I liked the conversations and topics broughout up throughout the book such as:

- What is real?
- The value of privacy and anonimity
- Identity (who / what are you)?

Again, questions that stories like the ones mentioned earlier explore as well. I liked how Tim presented both sides of the argument with scenarios in which characters were presented with situations where they had to consider and sympathize with viewpoints that challenged their stance.
