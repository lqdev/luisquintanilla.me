## Description

> In this New York Times and Los Angeles Times bestseller, comedic actor, producer, and writer Rainn Wilson explores the problem-solving benefits that spirituality gives us to create solutions for an increasingly challenging world.  
> <br>
> The trauma that our struggling species has experienced in recent years—because of both the pandemic and societal tensions that threaten to overwhelm us—is not going away anytime soon. Existing political and economic systems are not enough to bring the change that the world needs. In this book, Rainn Wilson explores the possibility and hope for a spiritual revolution, a “Soul Boom,” to find a healing transformation on both a personal and global level.  
> <br>
> For Wilson, this is a serious and essential pursuit, but he brings great humor and his own unique perspective to the conversation. He feels that, culturally, we’ve discounted spirituality—faith and the sacred—and we need profound healing and a unifying understanding of the world that the great spiritual traditions provide. Wilson’s approach to spirituality—the non-physical, eternal aspects of ourselves—is relatable and applies to people of all beliefs, even the skeptics. Filled with genuine insight—not to mention enlightening Kung Fu and Star Trek references—Soul Boom delves into ancient wisdom to seek out practical, transformative answers to life’s biggest questions.

## Review

In this book, Rainn explores the impact of society's distancing from the spiritual and religion. Using examples from various world religions and personal annecdotes, he argues that despite the perceived differences, there is a core set of principles they all share. Using these core principles as the foundation, he makes the case for taking the "good parts" and bringing them into your own life as a means of reconnecting with the spiritial and the divine. Ultimately, through this reconnection, not only does it lead to more fulfilling personal experiences and relationships, but also a more conscientious society.
