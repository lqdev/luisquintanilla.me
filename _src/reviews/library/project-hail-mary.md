## Description

> Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission\u2014and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.  
> <br>
> Except that right now, he doesn\u2019t know that. He can\u2019t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it..  
>  <br>
> All he knows is that he\u2019s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he\u2019s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company..  
>  <br>
> His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it\u2019s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery\u2014and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species..  
>  <br>
> And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he\u2019s got to do it all alone..  
>  <br>
> Or does he?.  
>  <br>
> An irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could deliver, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian\u2014while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.
