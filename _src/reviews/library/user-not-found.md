## Description

> "Maybe it’s time to unleash my head from the scroll.”  
> <br>
> Prompted by a sequence of discouraging internet encounters, Felicity Fenton attempts to free herself from the tendrils of an online world we know, but struggle to look away from. She evaluates the endless distractions of being tethered to her device and all that comes with it: email, spam, texting, taking pictures, and social media (aka “the walls”). In lyrical prose that swerves into dream-like mirage, hilarious thoughts, social observations, and unwavering sadness, User Not Found is a powerful essay that is all too relatable.  

## Review

Quick read but very personal introspection into relationships with technology and connectedness.
