## Description

> Published in 1984, Hackers is universally acknowledged as the core history of computer culture. Almost forty years after its appearance, readers keep coming to this chronicle of three generations of hackingâ€”hacking in the true, creative sense where brilliant coders create magic with their fingertips. The book introduces the concept of the Hacker Ethic, which depicts a mindset that began at MIT in the 1950s and 1960s, and flourishes to this day as the wizardly of hackers powers the computers so deeply embedded in our lives.
