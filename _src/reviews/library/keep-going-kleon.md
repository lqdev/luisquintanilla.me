## Description

> The world is crazy. Creative work is hard. How do you keep going?  
> <br>
> In my previous books — the New York Times bestsellers Steal Like An Artist and Show Your Work! — I showed readers how to steal their way to a more creative life and then share their creativity to get discovered. In Keep Going, I show you 10 ways to stay creative, focused, and true to yourself:  
> <br>
> 1. Every day is Groundhog Day.
> 2. Build a bliss station.
> 3. Forget the noun, do the verb.
> 4. Make gifts.
> 5. The ordinary + extra attention = the extraordinary
> 6. Slay the art monsters.
> 7. You’re allowed to change your mind.
> 8. When in doubt, tidy up.
> 9. Demons hate fresh air.
> 10. Plant your garden.
> <br>
> Whether you’re burned out, starting out, starting over, or wildly successful, Keep Going will help you stay on the path to more creative work.
