## Description

> Among the most profound and influential explorations of mind-expanding psychedelic drugs ever written, here are two complete classic books—The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell—in which Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, reveals the mind's remote frontiers and the unmapped areas of human consciousness. This edition also features an additional essay, "Drugs That Shape Men's Minds," now included for the first time.

## Review

The version I read only covered the first part of this essay, The Doors of Perception. A large portion of this book covers Huxley's experiences during altered states of consciousness. The part I found most interesting was his commentary and comparisons between the society of the time's understanding of science, spirituality, and consciousness and those of ancient or native traditions.
