## Description

> “The Diaries and Adam and Eve” by Mark Twain was originally published as two separate stories and were later combined at Twain’s request. “Extracts from Adam’s Diary” was published as a stand-alone book in 1904. In 1905, “Eve’s Diary” was published in the Christmas issue of “Harper’s Bazaar” and then as a book in 1906. With his signature wit and charm, Twain tells the separate stories of humanity’s biblical ancestors from the perspective of each in the form of diary entries. As one would expect from one of America’s greatest humorist, Adam and Eve’s diaries are funny and clever interpretations of these classic biblical tales. Adam is portrayed as lazy, cranky, and disinterested in the new, long-haired creature he suddenly finds with him in the Garden of Eden. Eve, in contrast, is enthusiastic, chatty, and brimming with curiosity about the enchanting and abundant life around them. The couple’s children, Cain and Abel, also make a brief appearance, though Adam is characteristically uninterested and Eve is left to the do all the hard work. Twain’s retelling of this classic and ancient myth is touching, funny, and an essential addition to the library of anyone who appreciates one of America’s best storytellers. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes the original illustration of F. Strothmann and Lester Ralph.

## Review

This was a short and fun read. Throughout the beginning of Eve's diary, while in the Garden of Eden, I found myself laughing out loud. After the fall though, Eve's diary takes a more serious tone. At the end of her diary, I felt the sentiments Adam expressed.

Adam's diary had its moments as well and similar to Eve's, the end was touching. 

## Quotes

> ADAM: Wheresoever she was, THERE was Eden.

> [NOTE.—I translated a portion of this diary some years ago, and a friend of mine printed a few copies in an incomplete form, but the public never got them. Since then I have deciphered some more of Adam’s hieroglyphics, and think he has now become sufficiently important as a public character to justify this publication.—M. T.]

> After all these years, I see that I was mistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better to live outside the Garden with her than inside it without her. At first I thought she talked too much; but now I should be sorry to have that voice fall silent and pass out of my life. Blessed be the chestnut that brought us near together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart and the sweetness of her spirit!
