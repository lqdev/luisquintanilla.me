## Description

> Nearly everyone is familiar with hologramsâ€”three-dimensional images projected into space with the aid of a laser. Two of the world's most eminent thinkers believe that the universe itself may be a giant hologram, quite literally a kind of image or construct created, at least in part, by the human mind. University of London physicist David Bohm, a protÃ©gÃ© of Einstein and one of the world's most respected quantum physicists, and Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram, an architect of our modern understanding of the brain, have developed a remarkable new way of looking at the universe. Their theory explains not only many of the unsolved puzzles of physics but also such mysterious occurrences as telepathy, out-of-body and near-death experiences, "lucid" dreams, and even religious and mystical experiences such as feelings of cosmic unity and miraculous healings.

## Review

The book starts by using science and the understanding of physics at the time to establish the thesis that the universe is a hologram or simulation. Using this as the foundation, Talbot then explores various natural and supernatural phenomenon such as the placebo effect, stigmata, altered states of consciousness (meditation, hypnosis, lucid dreaming, astral projection, psychedelics), UFOs, near-death-experiences, and uses them as evidence of the latent abilities to shape reality. 

I haven't dived deep into any of the topics and claims made in this book. However, given this book is over 30 years old, personally I'm not aware of shocking new revelations about any of the topics mentioned and they still appear to be in large part considered fringe by the mainstream. Maybe UFOs is one where at the time of this writing there's been hearings at various levels in the U.S. government in recent years. Also, there were reports of UFO / UAV sightings in the New York and New Jersey area over the holidays in 2024.

The truth is out there. I want to believe. ðŸ›¸
