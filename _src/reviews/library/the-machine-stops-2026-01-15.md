summary: "> The Machine Stops is set in a world where humanity lives underground and relies on a giant machine to provide its needs.  Although this book was written 115 years ago, it does a good job of describing parts of our world today. Although technology fails, the same lessons apply to any system. Once we become so detached and blindly trust the a system works (tech, government, enterprises) without understanding how it works, we stop questioning and just accept things. That puts us in a vulnerable situation and when small cracks in the system form, we'll be unable to detect them until it's too late and the system is broken beyond repair. Because it's a short story, the book immediately dumps you into this future world and as mentioned earlier, despite the book being written so long ago, it was in easy to follow."
