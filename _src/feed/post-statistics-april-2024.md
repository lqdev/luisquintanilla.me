My [website stats script](/posts/website-metrics-github-actions/) seems to be running as expected. 

Some highlights from last month:

- With 33 notes posted in the microblog, I'm about 80% of the way to the number of total notes posted last year. These monthly summary posts, as well as my [Crate Finds](/notes/crate-finds-march-2024) and [Weekly Summary](/notes/2024-04-01-weekly-post-summary/) posts have somewhat contributed to this number but I like the pace I'm setting. Not even halfway through the year and it looks promising. 
- While most of my responses are reshares (93), there's still a broader distribution across bookmarks and other type of reponses posts.
- AI continue to be the main topic I share posts around.
- The Verge is still one of the main sources I reshare. Personally, the redesign has contributed to the way I consume content from The Verge but also, the topics covered align with many of the things I'm interested in. 

I have yet to make progress on the long-form posts, but there are some experiments I've been tinkering with that will eventually make it on there.
