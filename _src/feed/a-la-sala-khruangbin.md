The first half of 2024 will be good for new music. [Chicano Batman is releasing something](/responses/chicano-batman-fly-01-2024) in the next few days. Last night I found out Khruangbin released a new single, Love International, and has a [new album coming out called A La Sala on April 5th](https://khruangbin.bandcamp.com/album/a-la-sala). I can't wait!
