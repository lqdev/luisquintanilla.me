Exciting developments in the ActivityPub space. A few months ago, the [WordPress plugin](/feed/wordpress-activitypub-plugin) was released. In the last few days, Threads recently started testing their [ActivityPub integration](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/24000120/threads-meta-activitypub-test-mastodon). Not so new but new to me, I saw that [Discourse, the forum software, also has an ActivityPub plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/activitypub-plugin/266794). [Flipboard](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/18/24006062/flipboard-fediverse-mastodon-activitypub-profiles-social) is one of the latest names to express plans for ActivityPub integration. Not sure what the end result will look like when all these platforms are all interoping with each other but I'm excited to see platforms building on open protocols.
