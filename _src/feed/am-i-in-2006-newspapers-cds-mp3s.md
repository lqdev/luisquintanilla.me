While flipping through a local (physical) newspaper, I came across an ad for a sale happening at a nearby record store.

Having nothing planned, I decided to check it out and ended up with a nice haul of about 15 CDs and 2 DVDs.

I fired up my [portable CD/DVD drive](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-8x-external-usb-double-layer-dvdrw-cd-rw-drive-black/5852919.p?skuId=5852919) to transfer my new purchases to my [portable MP3 player](https://www.fiio.com/m6).

Once finished, I popped one of the DVDs into the drive, made popcorn, and settled in. If I didn't know any better, this could easily be a scene from 2006.
