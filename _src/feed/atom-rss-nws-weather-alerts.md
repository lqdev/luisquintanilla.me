Yesterday I ran into more feed goodness. When going to a website to get the weather forecast, weather alerts are displayed (if there are any). 

I thought, wouldn't it be great to be able to subscribe to those alerts without having to go to the website? 

A quick search revealed the National Weather Service provides these alerts in ATOM format for each of the states in the U.S. 
You have the option of tracking updates at the national, state, zone, and county level. 

Subscribing is as easy as adding the link for the respective feed to your favorite feed reader. If you're interested, you can find the list of feeds at [https://alerts.weather.gov/](https://alerts.weather.gov/)
