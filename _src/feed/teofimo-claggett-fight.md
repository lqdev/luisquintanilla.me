## Ring Walk

Didn't see Claggett's but Lopez ring was was a little cringe.

## Scorecard (Unofficial)

| Round | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lopez | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10| 10 | ? | 10 | 9 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Claggett | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | 9 | ? | 9 | 10 | 9 | 9 | 9 |

## Rd 1

Claggett put more pressure but Lopez got in the better shots and looked in control even boxing off his back foot. 

## Rd 2

Claggett still putting in a lot of pressure but Teofimo still looks in control.

## Rd 3

Teofimo still in control. Claggett has some damage to the face but still keeps going forward. 

## Rd 4

Some nasty shots from Teofimo but Claggett still keeps coming forward. 

## Rd 5

Solid back and forth

## Rd 6

Claggett is solid. Making Teofimo work and he's got some wear on his face. 

## Rd 7

PC battery died :)

## Rd 8

Big uppercuts from Teofimo but Claggett keeps coming forward.

## Rd 9

Claggett keeps coming forward and he landed some good shots. 

## Rd 10

Teofimo stole the round at the end. Not like he needed to. He got the better shots. Sad to see because Claggett is putting the pressure but not doing as much damage.

## Rd 11

Much of the same. Claggett reguses to go away. Sadly, he hasn't done enough that if / when it goes the distance, he'll lose. He needs a knowckout and it looks unlikely. 

## Rd 12

Teofimo still looked fresh in this one. Claggett still kept the pressure though

## Verdict

I'd be surprised if Lopez didn't win. Claggett showed a lot of heart and made Teofimo uncomfortable. Sadly it wasn't enough though.
