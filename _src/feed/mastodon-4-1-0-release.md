Mastodon [v4.1.0](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.1.0) was released yesterday. This was a highly anticipated release for me since it introduced the option to [remove old cached profile media](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pull/22149) which was taking up a significant portion of my disk space.

After upgrading, I was able to cut my used disk space in half.

If you're running your own instance or have the ability to contact your instance admin, I can't recommend upgrading to this version enough.
