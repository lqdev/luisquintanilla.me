> There are seven key patterns. Theyâ€™re also organized along the spectrum of improving performance vs. reducing cost/risk, and closer to the data vs. closer to the user.
> 
> - Evals: To measure performance
> - RAG: To add recent, external knowledge
> - Fine-tuning: To get better at specific tasks
> - Caching: To reduce latency & cost
> - Guardrails: To ensure output quality
> - Defensive UX: To anticipate & manage errors gracefully
> - Collect user feedback: To build our data flywheel
