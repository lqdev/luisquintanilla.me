Off to a good start. 

In the month of January, I wrote two long-form posts:

- [Building a Reading Habit with Audiobooks, LibriVox, and AntennaPod](/posts/listen-audiobooks-librivox-antennapod/)
- [Deploy your own Owncast server](/posts/deploy-owncast-azure/)

Last year, I published about seven of them.

As I tinker some more [live on stream](/feed/first-owncast-stream) and use blog posts as a more structured way to orgqanize my explorations, I expect this year to have a healthy number of longer-form blog posts. 

Notes and responses are not too far behind either. Both of them are at 14 in January. That's about 10% and 5% the number of posts in both of those categories last year. I haven't been reposting things I'm reading as often, but I'd like to start doing that some more. 

Similar to long-form posts, as I [reflect on each stream and publish the recordings](/notes/tinkering-deepseek-r1-dotnet-github-models), I expect at least one note every one or two weeks just for the stream.  

No surprise, tags on my posts continue to be related to AI. 

This month I didn't really do the monthly [music playlist](/tags/cratefinds) kind of posts. If I were to quickly summarize the music on repeat this month, it'd be the [Andre 3000 album, New Blue Sun](/responses/andre-3000-listening-to-the-sun).
