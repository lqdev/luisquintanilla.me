About 2 episodes into the show [Archive 81](https://www.netflix.com/title/80222802) on Netflix and so far so good. I listened to a few episodes of the [podcast](https://www.archive81.com/) (by the same name) it's based on a few years ago. Now it makes me want to go back and listen to it again. It also makes me think about what the [Black Tapes](https://theblacktapespodcast.com/) could've been had it gotten a TV or movie adaptation. If you're into the found footage, cult horror type of stories (think Blair Witch + Midsommar + Rosemary's Baby), definitely check it out.
