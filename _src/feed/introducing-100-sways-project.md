Introducing the 100 Sways project.

Over the next few months, I plan on creating artifacts like blog posts, newsletters, and websites using [Microsoft Sway](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/). 

Bookmark the site [100sways.lqdev.tech](http://100sways.lqdev.tech) and follow along!

Note: If you can't access the website, you can use the [direct link (https://sway.cloud.microsoft/aC19McbR3xcNo6s8)](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/aC19McbR3xcNo6s8).

## What is the 100 Sways project?

This project is an attempt to show how you might use Sway as a publishing platform for content like newsletters, blog posts, and websites.

This project was inspired by [James'](https://jamesg.blog/) [100 things you can do on your personal website post](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/).

## Motivations

- Learn more about Microsoft Sway
- Show how you can make the most use out of apps and services already included with your Microsoft Account
- Show how easy it is to create and consume web content using Sway
