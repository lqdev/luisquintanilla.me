Defense is clutch. As always in big games, they'll have to work overtime just to keep the offense in the game.

**12:42**

Progress...at least there was no turnover on the last series.

Going for it on 4th & 2 feels like that 4th & 5 from a few years ago.

**15:30**

Defense showed up today. Can't expect to win a game with 3 turnovers.
