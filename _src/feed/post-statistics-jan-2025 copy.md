I haven't published much this past month. Notes and responses are significantly down from last year. 

That said, I'm happy that so far I've published seven long-form blog posts, which is how many I published all of last year. 

I haven't spent as much time bookmarking and resharing content. Partially due to the fact that I'm still working on the redesign. So far [vibe-specing](/posts/vibe-specing-prompt-to-spec/) the redesign hasn't yielded good enough results. Maybe I need to break down my problem further. That experience on its own might make a good blog post.

Part of the challenge with the redesign is that I'm trying to find a balance between standardizing my front-matter YAML schemas so that I can simplify my code and just have a single function handle the parsing of the front-matter, while at the same time enabling custom rendering depending on the post type. I think in the end what I'll end up doing is having different schemas per post type and maybe refactoring some of my code to remove redundancies.
