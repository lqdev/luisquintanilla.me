Finally got a working prototype. A few days ago I added the [request](/snippets/webmentions-request-verification) and [webmention](/snippets/webmentions-verification) verification components.

I just finished creating the web API and Azure Table Storage components. Now I just need to run some additional tests and deploy it :slightly_smiling_face:
