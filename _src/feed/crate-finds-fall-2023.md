Trying something new out I'm calling Crate Finds. I'm using it as a means to look back at either new music I came across or music I'm listening to at various points in time. Kind of like Spotify Wrapped, but less stats and aggregates and more point-in-time snapshots without the granuliarity of scrobbler services like Last.fm.

This is the first drop from Fall 2023.
