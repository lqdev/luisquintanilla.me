Came accross this event series via [Chris Aldrich's microblog](https://boffosocko.com/type/status/).

Here's Chris' original post

> Every Monday, I sit down with a cup of coffee and learn something interesting about history through old manuscripts. Join our friends Dot Porter ([@leoba](https://twitter.com/leoba)) and the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies ([@sims_mss](https://twitter.com/sims_mss)) at [Coffee with a Codex](https://schoenberginstitute.org/coffee-with-a-codex/).

Basically it's a virtual meeting where experts go over manuscripts on a variety of topics. I'll probably check out next week's event.
