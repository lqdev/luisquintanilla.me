About a week ago, I was telling [maho.dev](https://maho.dev/) about Owncast and my [self-hosted setup](/posts/deploy-owncast-azure). 

During our chat, the question of simulcasting came up. 

I used the [guidance from the OBS community](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-studio-stream-to-multiple-platforms-or-channels-at-once.932/) as a starting point, I decided to try it out for myself. 

It didn't work as-is but after using an AI assistant to help me tweak the ffmpeg command, I was able to get it working.

I posted the command to my [Wiki](/wiki/owncast.md) and plan on writing a more detailed post at a later time.
