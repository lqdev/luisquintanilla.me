Today I learned about canonical URLs. While looking into how I can syndicate content from this site, specifically longer form blog posts on other sites like dev.to, I came across canonical tags. 

Basically they're a way of telling the internet, specifically search engines, what version of your content is the main copy or single-source of truth. 

Currently I've configured my site so it's not indexed or crawled. However, for sites I don't own I don't have the same level of control. Check out the [canonicalization](https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization) and [SEO best practices for canonical URLs](https://moz.com/blog/rel-canonical) articles from Moz if you're interested in learning more.
