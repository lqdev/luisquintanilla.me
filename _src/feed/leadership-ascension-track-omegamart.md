Excerpts from the Omega Mart Leadership Ascension Track (LAT)

## Meeting the self

- Make a human pyramid with your high school guidance counselor and middle school crush.

## Renouncing the body

- Contribute 14% of your net worth to Drampcorp.
- Be nice to 77 dogs.

## Understanding nature 

- Learn to suck venom out of a snake bite.
- Befriend a snake.
- Interview a rock and ghost write its memoir.
- Spend a week in the desert, living off the land.

## Harmonizing with the essence

- Buy two cakes. Decorate and dedicate one of the cakes to the other. Stack the cakes. Leave them both on a neighbor's doorstep in a ding-dong-ditch scenario. 
- Swim to a whirlpool and dance within its rotating waves (hint: go with the flow).

## Moving beyond

- Approach a stranger in a coffee shop, have them show you their laptop search history, find the second-most recent country they've searched and move there for 7 months.

## Come to peace with the infinite

- Use an infinity mirror to get ready for a night on the town.

## Manifesting the self

- Take a childhood photo to the top of a mountain. Bury the photo and create a new peak. 
- One day a week, wake at dawn and meditate until sundown.
