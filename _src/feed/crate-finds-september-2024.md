This month had a mix of genres. Some of the ones I kept coming back to:

- Wharf Rat by Grateful Dead
- Deal by Grateful Dead
- God is Love by Marvin Gaye
- Save the Children by Marvin Gaye

I listened to [the album What's Going On a few times throughout the month](/responses/marvin-gaye-whats-going-on/).
