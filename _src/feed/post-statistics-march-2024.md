Another successful run of my [monthly script to track post statistics](/posts/website-metrics-github-actions/).

Some highlights:

- Over 100 responses through the month of February. That's basically halfway through the total number of responses I posted in 2023. 
- Almost 20 notes. Similar to responses, I'm halfway through the total number of notes posted last year. 

I've never done [100 days to offload](https://100daystooffload.com/). Unintentionally though, between notes and responses, I'm well past it. 

When it comes to more long-form posts, I haven't posted as many. Still only at 1 for the year. However, there's a few projects I'm looking to undertake that involve some of my publishing practices and AI. That should result in a healthy number of longer blog posts.
