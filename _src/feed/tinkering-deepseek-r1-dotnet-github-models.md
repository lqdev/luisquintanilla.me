I saw that the [DeepSeek R1 model is now on GitHub Models and Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deepseek-r1-is-now-available-on-azure-ai-foundry-and-github/), so I decided to start a stream and play around with in the GitHub Models playground as well as a .NET application. 

Here's the recording.

I rambled on stream since it's my stream of consciousness as I'm tinkering with these technologies.
