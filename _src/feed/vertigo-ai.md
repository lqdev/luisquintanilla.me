[Vertigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertigo_(film)) is one of my all time favorite movies, so I was excited to learn about [Vertigo AI](http://www.chrispeters.com/vertigo-ai-experiment/). Vertigo AI is an experiment that trained a model on footage from the film Vertigo to produce its own original short film. There aren't many details on the AI aspects of it, but I suspect there's a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) similar to [Norman](http://norman-ai.mit.edu/) behind it. Check out the generated movie.
