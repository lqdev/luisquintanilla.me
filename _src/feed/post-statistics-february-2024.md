Success! 

At the end of last year, I [created an automated script to tally some basic stats about my posts](/posts/website-metrics-github-actions/) on this site. 

Last month, due to user error, it [triggered but failed to run susccessfully](/notes/post-statistics-gh-actions-working-almost).

This month though, it ran as expected!

Some highlights:

- I'm posting more notes (short micro-blog style content). Through January, I'm already over 30% of total notes posted last year which is what I'm working towards.
- I've already posted 50 response posts through January. This is already over 20% of total responses published last year (223)!
- I'm resharing more than bookmarking. Still figuring that one out but I think this is a good start.
