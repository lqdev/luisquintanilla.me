After about a month of not being able to access my Mastodon instance, I'm so excited to have it working again! 

Not sure what I did wrong with my upgrade to 4.3.0. Fortunately, the issues appears to have been on the frontend and the fix wasn't too involved. 

Upgrading to the latest 4.3.1 fixed the issue I ran into during my last upgrade. 

Thanks to my [POSSE setup](/posts/rss-to-mastodon-posse-azure-logic-apps/), I've been able to continue posting to my website and syndicating to Mastodon. Unfortunately, since the frontend wasn't working, I was unable to access my notifications. Because the mobile apps make use of the web frontend to log in, I couldn't use the mobile app either.
