This Utah defense are the real MVPs. Utah hasn't been able to put together a drive all game. So far I think I've seen 3-4 turnovers. The fact that Northwestern is ONLY up by 7 is shocking.

Make it make sense. Something must've happened. Maybe injuries or something. This season they:

- Beat Florida
- Beat USC
- Had a close game against Washington which is now in the playoffs

Yet they can't put together a drive. Something doesn't add up.
