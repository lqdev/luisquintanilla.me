> The open-source Project Jupyter, used by millions for data science and machine learning, has released Jupyter AI, a free tool bringing powerful generative AI capabilities to Jupyter notebooks.

> Jupyter AI, which brings generative AI to Jupyter. Jupyter AI provides a user-friendly and powerful way to explore generative AI models in notebooks and improve your productivity in JupyterLab and the Jupyter Notebook. More specifically, Jupyter AI offers:
> 
> - An %%ai magic that turns the Jupyter notebook into a reproducible generative AI playground. This works anywhere the IPython kernel runs (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode, etc.).
> 
> - A native chat UI in JupyterLab that enables you to work with generative AI as a conversational assistant.
>
> - Support for a wide range of generative model providers and models (AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, OpenAI, SageMaker, etc.).
