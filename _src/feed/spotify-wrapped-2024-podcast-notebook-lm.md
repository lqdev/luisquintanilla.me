While looking at [Spotify Wrapped this year](/feed/spotify-wrapped-2024.md), I completely missed the AI-generated podcast that came along with it.

As cool as this is, **it should've been opt-in**. 

Although I would hope that when I clicked "I Agree" on the user agreement, the use of my data in this way is covered (for Spotify's sake), it's not clear or easy to find:

1. What data was shared with Google's NotebookLM
2. What Google will do with that data

There's a reason I purposefully haven't linked Spotify to other accounts. 

I know there's probably hundreds of worse ways my data is being used I don't know about. This one though was hard to miss and a sad reminder that often you don't learn about how your data is being used until after the fact. Cases like this are not really a big deal. So what if you know I was going through a "Witchy Jam Band Phsychedelic Rock" phase in September? Where it does matter though is when it involves more personal and sensitive data. Again, because we don't realize it until after the fact, it's not until then that we learn what we're giving up when we make the simple, often uninformed, decision to select "I Agree".
