It's been a little over a year since I started hosting my website on Azure. The resources I use include:

- Azure Storage: Where all my site assets are stored.
- Azure CDN: Content delivery
- Azure Logic Apps: Event-based jobs to syndicate new posts on Twitter and Mastodon.

I haven't tracked traffic for the entire year but since October of last year the site has gotten roughly 5,000 visitors. 

Taking all that into account, I've only had to pay $2.06 most of it being the storage I use for the site. In comparison, I was previously hosting my website through my domain provider in a shared server where it cost about $60!
