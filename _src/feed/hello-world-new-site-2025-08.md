Posting from my brand new redesigned website. 

I was working on it for about a month so I plan on doing a longer writeup on what has changed. 

There's still a few things that are broken, but for the most part, I'm happy with the progress and the changes that need to be made are incremental. 

There's a ton of cleanup as well but again. That is not a blocker to publishing the site.
