Lately I've been using github.dev to author posts and make light edits on this site. One use case where it's come extremely handy has been authoring content, specifically these microblog-like posts from my Surface Duo. Instead of opening the laptop, I can open up my Surface Duo and visit my site's repo through github.dev. When I orient the device in landscape mode I have one screen display the VS Code-like web environment while the other screen displays the keyboard. Snippets, version control, extensions, and themes all carry over making the experience consistent. Committing changes through the version control utilities immediately kicks off the GitHub Action to build and publish the site with the latest changes. Pairing the GitHub online editor environment with the Duo's dual-screen form factor showcases the productivity and convenience both of these products provide.
