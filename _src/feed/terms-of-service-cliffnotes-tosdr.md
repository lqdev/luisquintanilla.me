I recently came accross the [Terms of Service, Didn't Read (TOSDR)](https://tosdr.org/) website. Like most people, I'm guilty of clicking "I have read and agree to the terms of service" without actually doing so. TOSDR simplifies terms of service documents by highlighting the main points for many popular services. I'm not sure how maintenance and the frequency of that maintenance work. There's a rating systems which I also am not sure how it works. However, you are provided with the documents that were used to come up with the ratings and summaries, so you can look into it yourself. Overall, I think it's an incredibly useful tool to make sense of how your data is managed across these platforms.
