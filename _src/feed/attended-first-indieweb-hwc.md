Last night I attended my [first IndieWeb Homebrew Website Club meeting](https://events.indieweb.org/2025/01/homebrew-website-club-pacific-V49lZfOizy1E). Although it was my first, everyone was very welcoming and it felt like I'd been a longtime participant. It was also great to put faces to the many websites I already follow as well as discover new people in the community. Looking forward to the next one.
