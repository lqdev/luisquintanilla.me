No Windows 11 upgrade for me. ðŸ˜¥

![PC doesn't meet windows 11 upgrade requirements message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11130940/135946651-d4d9acee-5618-4846-85aa-8387077a4785.png)

Just because I can't doesn't mean you can't though. Go and check if you're eligible at Windows Update

**Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update**.

See [Manage updates in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/manage-updates-in-windows-643e9ea7-3cf6-7da6-a25c-95d4f7f099fe#WindowsVersion=Windows_10) for more details.

For alternative install options, check out the [Download Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) page.
