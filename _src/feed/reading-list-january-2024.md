Lately I've been using Spotify to listen to audiobooks since it's included as part of their Premium tier. That's how I started listening to [Making It In America](/library/making-it-in-america). What I didn't know was that there's a limit to the number of hours you can listen in a given month. I only got as far as chapter 2 and now I have to wait 7 days for my listening hours to be replenished for the month. 

As a result, I started building the reading backlog at the local library which is now at an unreasonable 164 books that I probably won't get to. It got that way because I added many of the Best of 2023 recommendations from my local library to my wishlist. I haven't added many of those to my [library page](/library) because I don't want to go through the process of manually adding them. I should look into whether there's an automated way of getting that information via APIs or batch download.

Last night I started reading [How To Sell A Haunted House](/library/how-to-sell-a-haunted-house) and I'm enjoying it so far. The next one on deck is [A City on Mars](/library/a-city-on-mars).
