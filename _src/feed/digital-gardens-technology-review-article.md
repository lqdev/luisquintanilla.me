Just read an interesting article publised in Technology Review called [Digital gardens let you cultivate your own little bit of the internet](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/).

In a sense, some of the updates to this site like the addition of the different feeds can be thought of as "cultivating" my own digital garden.
