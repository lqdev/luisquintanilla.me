A few days ago, Stability.ai released [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) and recently a painting generated using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/) won [first place](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/08/ai-wins-state-fair-art-contest-annoys-humans/) in the digital category of the Colorado State Fair fine art competition.
