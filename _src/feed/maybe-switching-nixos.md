Time to distro hop. Maybe. For the past two years I've been happily using Manjaro as my main distribution. During that time I've also kept an eye on the immutable distributions. One of the main ones I've been paying attention to is [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). Like Arch, it's taken me some time to wrap my head around it. Now that it's gotten easier to set up through a graphical installer, I'll start out with a live install to see how I like it.
