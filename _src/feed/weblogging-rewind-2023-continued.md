Yesterday I posted aggregate statistics about this website in the post [(We)blogging Rewind 2023](/feed/weblogging-rewind-2023).

I thought it'd be cool to see which domains I referenced most in my responses. Here's the breakdown of the top 5.

| Domain | Count |
| --- | --- |
| github.com | 15 |
| huggingface.co | 11 |
| arxiv.org | 10 |
| openai.com | 6 |
| www.theverge.com | 4 |

No surprise here given that AI was one of the top tags in my responses.
