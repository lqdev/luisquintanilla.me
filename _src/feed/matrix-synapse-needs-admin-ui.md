Spent the day playing sysadmin and removed about 50GB worth of data from my Matrix Synapse instance. Like Mastodon, most of that data wasn't even mine. Most of it comes is remote data from other users in large rooms. I really like Matrix and the ability to host my own messaging server that provides end-to-end encryption as well as federation with other instances. However, not having a straight-forward way of managing my server and cleaning up resources is painful. 

Anyway, if anyone is interested, here are some resources that have helped me in this process.
