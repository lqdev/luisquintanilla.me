Last I heard of Tumblr, they were owned by Verizon. While readying the book [Indie Microblogging](https://book.micro.blog/) by Manton Reece, I learned (and later confirmed) they were owned by Automaticc, the company behind WordPress. Out of the the different homes it's had, I can't think of a better place for it.
