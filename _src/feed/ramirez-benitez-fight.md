Ramirez dominated most of the fight but that knockout was insane. Watching it live, it wasn't easy to see but in the replay, Ramirez exploded from the botttom and nearly took Benitez' head off. He wasn't out cold but he got his bell rung and just didn't make the count. Still, I hope he's okay. He took a beating the rest of the fight.
