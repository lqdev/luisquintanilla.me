Nice! [i3-gaps](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#gaps) was recently merged into the main i3 codebase some  time ago and with the [4.22 release](https://github.com/i3/i3/blob/next/RELEASE-NOTES-4.22) a few weeks ago, you can now use it with your existing i3 configuration. I've started tinkering with it and I like the way it makes my desktop look.
