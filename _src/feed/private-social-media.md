Brain dumping a bunch of half-formed thoughts.

Over the past few days, I've been thinking about different forms of sharing content. With the [shifts in social media towards smaller, more private communities](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/19/technology/personaltech/tiktok-twitter-facebook-social.html), is it possible to get the best of feeds for sharing updates and information but in a smaller more intimate way?

Here's a few of the options I came up with:

## Journals

Examples: [Day One Shared Journals](https://dayoneapp.com/guides/tips-and-tutorials/shared-journals/)

- Pros
  - Made for an audience of one, but other can collaborate on it.
  - Depending on the interface, looking back at specific days and events that took place is easy to look back on.
  - May be able to include different forms of media (i.e. audio, video, photos)
- Cons
  - No individual profiles
  - May require everyone to use the same app / service

## E-mail

Examples: Newsletters, Mailing lists

- Pros
  - Almost everyone has an e-mail address.
  - Built on standard protocols.
  - Producers can use any app they'd like to compose e-mails.
  - Consumers can use any app they'd like to read e-mails.
  - Could use any app / client / service-provider they'd like. (Federated by default)
- Cons
  - Content rendering may differ based on app.
  - Could add to the noise already present in your e-mail inbox.
  - No individual accounts / feeds.

## Messaging Apps

Examples: Discord, Matrix, IRC, Slack, Signal

- Pros
  - Sharing could be done via SMS (though this would limit the content you share).
  - You could form various sub-groups to sub
- Cons
  - May require everyone to use the same app / service.
  - May not have a way to view individual profiles or feeds. 
  - Because conversations are not often grouped by topics, it might be difficult to find conversations, especially older conversations. 

## Private blogs

Examples: [Private WordPress Blog](https://wordpress.com/go/tutorials/private-blog-wordpress-com/), [Haven](https://havenweb.org/)

- Pros
  - Produces can use any tool / service to author and publish posts.
  - Consumers can access via any browser of their choice.
- Cons
  - May have to host your own service.
  - Consumers may have to create accounts and passwords for each of the private blogs they follow.

## Fediverse

Examples: Mastodon, PixelFed, PeerTube

- Pros
  - Familar social media interface.
  - More availability of apps and services that form part of the Fediverse make it easier for producers and consumers to use what makes the most sense for them.
- Cons
  - Limited to the format supported by the app / service (i.e. Pixelfed is for images / video, PeerTube for video, etc.).
  - May require you to host your own service.

## P2P Social Media

Examples: [ScuttleButt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/)

- Pros
  - Could be made for an audience of one but shared with other peers.
  - Decentralized by default.
  - Access individual feeds.
- Cons
  - Similar to the Fediverse, being exposed to new protocols and technical terms may make onboarding and adoption challenging.
  - May require you to host your own service.
  - Protocols haven't been widely adopted so users are limited in the apps / services they can use for this. 

## Forums

Examples: [NixOS Forum](https://discourse.nixos.org/), [Lemmy](https://lemmy.world/)

- Pros
  - Could create threads and conversations on various topics
  - Easy to search and tag content
- Cons
  - Someone would have to host a server
  - Might not work well for small groups 

## RSS feeds

This is a variation on the private blog. Except instead of having a website that displays the posts, you just have an RSS feed.

Examples: [RSS-Only Club](https://daverupert.com/2018/01/welcome-to-rss-club/)

- Pros
  - Producers can use any software they'd like to create and publish their RSS feed
  - Consumers can use any feed reader to access and read content
  - Everyone could have their own feed, so effectively they'd be like profiles
- Cons
  - You have to figure out how to produce and host the RSS feed
  - Can't really control who sees this since the feed is public. Maybe private feeds could help here.
  - Limited interaction. Users can't comment or reply to items in a feed.

Note that this is not an exhaustive list of pros and cons, just a few that I thought of. I persoanlly would skew towards e-mail and messaging apps. The main reason at least with e-mail is that everyone is familiar with it and most likely won't have to create separate accounts on various silos to communicate and engage with others. With apps like [DeltaChat](https://delta.chat/) you could actualy combine them and get the best of both. 

What are your thoughts?
