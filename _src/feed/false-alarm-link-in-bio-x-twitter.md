I may have spoken too early in my [post about X not displaying bio links correctly](/notes/no-link-in-bio-x-twitter). 

Not sure if it was a glitch or what was going on, but I now see my domain correctly displayed as the bio link. All good. 

I'd be interested in knowing whether others have experienced something similar.
