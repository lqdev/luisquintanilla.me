## Description

> In The Four Agreements, don Miguel Ruiz reveals the source of self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, The Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love.

## Review

I purchased the paperback version but ended up listening to the audiobook version while doing chores over the weekend (~2.5 hours). This book gets straight to the point. That point being, throughout our lives we enter into agreements with society that enforce beliefs and influence our behavior, happiness, and inner peace. By speaking with truth and love, not suffering from main character syndrome (not everything is about you), seeking to understand rather than make assumptions, and not striving for perfection but constant improvement, you can slowly create new agreements that are more in line with your higher self.
