## A Defining Work of Cyberpunk

William Gibson's *Neuromancer* isn't just a science fiction novel—it's the foundational text of cyberpunk. Published in 1984, it imagined a future of networked computers, artificial intelligence, and human augmentation that has become remarkably prescient.

The prose is dense and evocative, painting a neon-soaked world where the line between human and machine blurs. Case, our protagonist, is a damaged console cowboy navigating the digital frontier of cyberspace while entangled in corporate intrigue.

## Why It Still Matters

Nearly 40 years later, Gibson's vision of cyberspace—a term he coined—continues to influence how we think about the internet, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. The novel's exploration of AI consciousness remains relevant as we grapple with modern machine learning systems.

**Highly recommended** for anyone interested in the origins of cyberpunk or speculative fiction that tackles technology's impact on humanity.
