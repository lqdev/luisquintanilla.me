        ## Create a New Playlist Post
        
        Use this form to create a playlist post that will automatically generate a pull request with a properly formatted markdown file.
        
        The playlist-creator tool will fetch track information from Spotify and find YouTube links for each track.
        
        **Note**: This will create a new playlist post in the `_src/playlists/` directory and generate a PR for review.
