        ## Create a New Media Post
        
        Use this form to create a media post that will automatically generate a pull request with a properly formatted markdown file.
        
        **Note**: This will create a new media post in the `_src/media/` directory and generate a PR for review.
        
        **Media Type Detection**: The system will automatically detect media types (image, video, audio) based on file extensions and content patterns. You can mix different media types in the same post.
