## 📋 Development Workflow & Project Management

### Essential Workflow Pattern
1. **Initiate**: Clean active state → Research & plan → Begin structured logging
2. **Develop**: Incremental changes → Continuous testing → Real-time documentation
3. **Complete**: Comprehensive validation → Archive project → Update knowledge base

### Critical Project Rules
- **Single Active Focus**: Only current work in `projects/active/`
- **Structured Logging**: Phase logs for complex work, immediate cleanup after completion
- **Continuous Testing**: Build and validate after each significant change
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document all decisions and discoveries for future reference

### Project State Management
| State | Symbol | Location | Action |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Backlog** | `[ ]` | `projects/backlog.md` | Strategic planning and priorities |
| **Active** | `[>]` | `projects/active/[name].md` | Current work only |
| **Complete** | ✅ | `projects/archive/[name].md` | Archived with lessons learned |

### Development Process Framework

- **Immediate Cleanup**: Summarize in changelog and delete logs immediately upon completion
- **No Accumulation**: Only keep logs for currently active work
- **Changelog as Record**: Use `changelog.md` as permanent record with links to archived plans

## 🔧 Technical Standards & Proven Patterns

### F# Development Best Practices
- **Type-First Design**: Define types before functions, use them to drive API design
- **Module Responsibility**: Each module handles one concern (parsing, rendering, generation)
- **Function Sizing**: Consider refactoring if functions exceed 20 lines
- **Centralized Entry Points**: Single functions that handle complete workflows
- **Type Qualification**: Always use fully qualified types (`MediaType.Unknown` not `Unknown`)
- **Continuous Compilation**: Test build after each significant change
- **Module Dependencies**: Add new modules to project file immediately
- **Type Annotations**: Use explicit type annotations in test scripts to prevent inference issues

### ViewEngine Integration Pattern (Proven)
- **Type-Safe HTML Generation**: Use Giraffe ViewEngine instead of sprintf string concatenation
- **Render Function Pattern**: Convert `sprintf "<article>%s</article>" content` to `article [ _class "content" ] [ rawText content ]`
- **HTML String Output**: Use `RenderView.AsString.xmlNode viewNode` to convert ViewEngine nodes to HTML strings
- **Maintainability Benefits**: ViewEngine provides compile-time safety, cleaner code, and better refactoring support
- **Architecture Consistency**: Apply ViewEngine pattern across all Render functions for uniform approach

### Content Volume HTML Parsing Pattern (Critical Discovery)
**Discovery**: High content volumes (1000+ items) with `rawText` rendering can generate malformed HTML that breaks browser DOM parsing so severely that **no JavaScript loads at all**.

**Symptoms**:
- Script tags present in HTML source but absent from browser Network tab
- Zero JavaScript execution (not syntax errors - complete loading failure)  
- Full interface failure despite correct JavaScript code
- Content processing succeeds but browser parsing fails

**Root Cause**: Large content arrays with `rawText` rendering can produce malformed HTML that exceeds browser parser limits, causing complete DOM parsing failure before script loading.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- **Content Limiting Test**: Use `Array.take (min 10 items.Length)` to test if volume is the issue
- **Progressive Loading Strategy**: Implement virtual scrolling or pagination instead of artificial limits
- **HTML Validation**: Validate generated HTML structure with large content volumes
- **Performance Strategy**: Load content in chunks rather than restricting total content

### External Library Integration Pattern (Proven)
**Discovery**: External JavaScript libraries integrate excellently with content architecture when using container-relative sizing and conditional loading.

**Implementation Pattern**:
1. **Static Asset Strategy**: Copy library assets to public root (`/lib/`) not just under `/assets/lib/` for proper path resolution
2. **Container-Relative Sizing**: Use parent container dimensions (`width: 100%`) instead of viewport-based (`75vw`) for proper bounds
3. **Conditional Loading**: Detect library need via DOM elements (`document.querySelector()`) and load scripts only when required
4. **CSS Interference Minimization**: Use basic containment rules without complex overrides that conflict with library styling
5. **Layout Pattern Consistency**: External libraries work seamlessly with individual post patterns

### Custom Block Infrastructure Pattern (Proven)
- **Pipeline Ordering Critical**: Never use `UseAdvancedExtensions()` with custom block parsers - it includes built-in `CustomContainers` that consume custom syntax before our parsers
- **Individual Extensions**: Use specific extensions (`UsePipeTables()`, `UseGenericAttributes()`, etc.) to avoid conflicts
- **YAML Content Processing**: Post-process extracted YAML content to fix indentation and filter empty lines
- **Semantic HTML Output**: Custom blocks should render semantic HTML (`<figure>`, `<figcaption>`) with CSS classes for styling
- **Testing Approach**: Validate both YAML parsing (no exceptions) and HTML output (proper rendering vs raw text)

### Hidden IndieWeb Microformats Pattern (Proven)
**Discovery**: IndieWeb microformat compliance can be maintained while achieving clean visual design through strategic CSS hiding.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- **Microformat Structure**: Include complete `u-author h-card` with required properties (`u-photo`, `u-url`, `p-name`)
- **CSS Hiding Strategy**: Use `microformat-hidden` class with `display: none !important; visibility: hidden !important;`
- **Parser Compatibility**: Webmention parsers, feed readers, and IndieWeb tools can access author information
- **Visual Design**: Clean, minimal presentation without redundant author attribution

**Benefits**: Optimal user experience with clean design while maintaining full IndieWeb ecosystem compatibility.

### Progressive Loading Pattern (Proven)
**Discovery**: Successfully implemented static site progressive loading handling 1000+ content items without HTML parser failures.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- **Server-Side JSON Generation**: F# backend generates remaining content as properly escaped JSON
- **Client-Side Progressive Loading**: JavaScript consumes JSON for chunked content rendering
- **Safe Initial Load**: 50 items initially to prevent HTML parser overload
- **Progressive Chunks**: 25-item chunks loaded via intersection observer + manual button
- **Comprehensive JSON Escaping**: Handle all special characters (`\"`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\\`, etc.)
- **Filter Integration**: Progressive content automatically respects current filter state

**Benefits**: Handles any content volume while maintaining excellent performance and user experience on static sites.

### Content Type Landing Page Pattern (Proven)
**Discovery**: Proper landing pages for all content types significantly improve content discoverability and user experience, following consistent structural patterns.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- **Response-Based Filtering**: Use existing content with type metadata (`response_type: bookmark`) rather than creating separate file structures
- **CollectionViews.fs Updates**: Modify view functions for proper landing page structure (h2 header, descriptive paragraph, chronological list)
- **Builder Function Creation**: Create dedicated filtering and page generation functions (`buildBookmarksLandingPage`)
- **Build Integration**: Add function calls to main Program.fs orchestration after data collection
- **View Function Reuse**: Leverage existing view functions (`responseView`) for consistent UI across content types
- **Directory Management**: Automatic directory creation and index.html generation following `/content-type/index.html` pattern

**Success Criteria**: Landing page parity across content types, proper content filtering, chronological ordering, and seamless build process integration.

### Feed Architecture Consistency Pattern (Proven)
**Discovery**: Unified feed pattern consistency with prominent subscription hub placement dramatically improves user experience and maintains architectural coherence.

**Implementation Pattern**:
- **Consistent URL Structure**: All feeds follow `/[type]/feed.xml → /[alias].rss` pattern including unified feed
- **Subscription Hub Integration**: Feature important feeds prominently with clear descriptions and user-friendly URLs
- **User-Friendly Aliases**: Memorable URLs like `/all.rss` for easy sharing and subscription
- **OPML Integration**: Include featured feeds as first entries in subscription management systems
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing URLs during pattern transitions through dual file generation
- **Pattern Documentation**: Clear documentation of URL structures and alias relationships

**Benefits**: Improved feed discoverability, consistent architecture patterns, better user experience, and simplified maintenance.

- **New Tab Strategy**: `target="_blank"` preserves user's place in text-only site
- **HTML Structure Preservation**: Maintain all other HTML content (headings, lists, links) exactly as-is

**TextOnlyContentProcessor Enhancement**:
```fsharp
// Replace only images with clickable text descriptions, keeping all other HTML
let replaceImagesWithText (content: string) =
    if String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(content) then ""
    else
        let mutable result = content
        
        // Replace images with alt text first (more specific pattern)
        let imgWithAltPattern = @"<img[^>]*src\s*=\s*[""']([^""']*)[""'][^>]*alt\s*=\s*[""']([^""']*)[""'][^>]*/?>"
        result <- Regex.Replace(result, imgWithAltPattern, fun m ->
            let src = m.Groups.[1].Value
            let alt = m.Groups.[2].Value
            let description = if String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(alt) then "Image" else alt
            let fullUrl = if src.StartsWith("http") then src else $"https://www.luisquintanilla.me{src}"
            $"""<a href="{fullUrl}" target="_blank">[Image: {description}]</a>"""
        )
        
        // Handle images without alt text (catch remaining images)
        let imgWithoutAltPattern = @"<img[^>]*src\s*=\s*[""']([^""']*)[""'][^>]*/?>"
        result <- Regex.Replace(result, imgWithoutAltPattern, fun m ->
            let src = m.Groups.[1].Value
            let fullUrl = if src.StartsWith("http") then src else $"https://www.luisquintanilla.me{src}"
            $"""<a href="{fullUrl}" target="_blank">[Image]</a>"""

- **GREEN Decision Application**: Immediately remove obvious obsolete files (debug scripts, logs, migration artifacts)
- **Backup Directory Assessment**: Evaluate migration artifacts for safe removal based on age and Git history
- **Build Validation**: Verify system integrity after each cleanup phase
- **Documentation Cleanup**: Remove temporary analysis files after completion

**Benefits**: Significant build performance improvement, space recovery, clean active directory state.
