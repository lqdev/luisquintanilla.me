# Playlist Collections

## Overview

Playlist Collections are curated music playlists organized by theme or time period (typically monthly "Crate Finds"). Each playlist provides YouTube and Spotify links for maximum accessibility, allowing listeners to enjoy music regardless of their preferred platform. The system generates individual pages for each playlist with proper formatting and links.

## Features

- **Monthly Music Discoveries**: Curated "Crate Finds" playlists featuring new discoveries and favorites
- **Dual Platform Links**: YouTube primary links with Spotify backups for accessibility
- **Track Metadata**: Includes artist, album, duration, and links for each track
- **Collection Index**: Organized listing of all playlists at `/collections/playlists/`
- **Tag System**: Playlists are fully integrated with the site's tag system
- **Markdown-Based**: Simple markdown format for easy playlist creation

## Content Structure

### Frontmatter Fields

```yaml
---
title: "Playlist Title"                     # Required: Playlist name
date: "2025-07-01 20:00 -05:00"            # Required: Publication date with timezone
tags: ["cratefinds", "music", "playlist"]   # Required: Array of tags
description: "Optional description"         # Optional: Brief playlist description
---
```

### Track List Format

Playlists use a standardized markdown format for tracks:

```markdown
## Tracks

1. **Track Title** by Artist Name
   - Album: *Album Name*
   - Duration: 4:42
   - [Listen on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=...)

   - Duration: 3:15
   - [Listen on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=...)
   - [Backup: Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/...)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Domain Types

```fsharp
type PlaylistDetails = {
    Title: string
    Description: string option
    Date: string
    Tags: string array
}

type PlaylistCollection = {
    FileName: string
    Metadata: PlaylistDetails
    Content: string  // Raw markdown content with track lists
}
with
    interface ITaggable
```

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Load**: `loadPlaylistCollections` reads markdown files from `_src/playlists/`
2. **Parse**: YAML frontmatter parsed into `PlaylistDetails`
3. **Process**: Markdown content rendered to HTML
4. **Generate**: Individual pages created at `/collections/playlists/{slug}/`
5. **Index**: Collection index page created at `/collections/playlists/`

### Build Process

**Builder.fs Integration:**
```fsharp
let playlistCollectionFiles = 
    let playlistPath = Path.Join(srcDir, "playlists")
    if Directory.Exists(playlistPath) then
        Directory.GetFiles(playlistPath)

let feedData = GenericBuilder.buildContentWithFeeds processor playlistCollectionFiles

// Generate individual playlist pages
for item in feedData do
    let playlistCollection = item.Content
    let saveDir = Path.Join(outputDir, "collections", "playlists", playlistCollection.FileName)
    // ... generate page

// Generate playlist collections index
let playlistCollections = feedData |> Array.map (fun item -> item.Content)
let indexHtml = playlistCollectionsPageView playlistCollections
```

### View Functions

**Collection Index** (`playlistCollectionsPageView`):
```fsharp
let playlistCollectionsPageView (playlistCollections: PlaylistCollection array) = 
    div [ _class "d-grip gap-3" ] [
        h2[] [Text "Playlists"]
        p [] [Text "Monthly music discoveries and favorites..."]
        ul [] [
            for playlist in playlistCollections do
                li [] [
                    a [ _href $"/collections/playlists/{playlist.FileName}"] [ Text playlist.Metadata.Title ]
                    // Description and date...
                ]
        ]
    ]
```

**Individual Playlist** (`playlistCollectionDetailView`):
```fsharp
let playlistCollectionDetailView (playlistCollection: PlaylistCollection) (processedContent: string) =
    div [ _class "playlist-collection-detail" ] [
        h1 [] [ Text playlistCollection.Metadata.Title ]
        // Description (optional)
        // Date
        // Tags
        div [ _class "playlist-content mt-4" ] [
            rawText processedContent  // Rendered track list
        ]
    ]
```

## URL Structure

```
/collections/playlists/                      # Playlist index
/collections/playlists/crate-finds-june-2025/  # Individual playlist
```

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: Monthly Music Discovery

**"Crate Finds" Series:**
- Monthly playlists featuring discovered music
- Mix of new releases and classic finds
- Organized chronologically for easy browsing

**Benefits:**
- Platform-agnostic listening (YouTube + Spotify)
- Track metadata preserved (artist, album, duration)
- Easy sharing via permalink
- Integrated with site's tag system

### Alternative Use Cases

**Themed Playlists:**
- Genre-specific collections
- Mood-based playlists
- Artist deep dives
- Seasonal compilations

**Event Playlists:**
- Party mixes
- Study/work music
- Travel soundtracks

## Platform Accessibility

### YouTube as Primary Platform

**Advantages:**
- No account required for listening
- Available globally
- Embedded player optional
- No tracking by default

**Implementation:**
```markdown
[Listen on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...)
```

### Spotify as Backup

**Advantages:**
- High audio quality
- Playlist preservation
- Mobile app integration
- Offline listening (with subscription)

**Implementation:**
```markdown
[Backup: Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/...)
```

### Privacy Considerations

**Why Not Embedded Players:**
1. **No Spotify embeds**: Avoids analytics/tracking concerns
2. **YouTube links only**: User controls playback environment
3. **User choice**: Listeners choose their preferred platform
4. **Minimal footprint**: No third-party JavaScript on pages

## Automation Tools

### Playlist Creator Script

A companion tool generates properly formatted playlists:

**GitHub Repository:** [playlist-creator](https://github.com/lqdev/playlist-creator)

**Features:**
- Spotify playlist â†’ Markdown conversion
- Automatic YouTube link discovery
- Track metadata extraction
- Formatted output ready for publishing

**Workflow:**
1. Create Spotify playlist
2. Run playlist-creator script
3. Review/edit generated markdown
4. Add to `_src/playlists/`
5. Build site to publish

## Best Practices
