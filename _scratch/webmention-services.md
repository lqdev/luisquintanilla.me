## Webmentions Services

A list of potential self-hosted web services that accept Webmentions:

- Aggregator / Collaborative Blog: Similar to Indieweb.xyz and news.indieweb.org. 
- Business Page: Similar to business page on Facebook or Yelp. Business can claim as their business because they own the domain name. Has basic information about details. Provide feed so that users can subscribe to updates. Post reviews / user comments on the page as testimonials. 
- Product Page: Similar to business page description but specific to notebooks. 
- Community Page / Group: A mix between aggregator and Business Page. It'd be like Facebook Groups. The page would have basic information about the community. Webmentions would be an aggregation of posts for members of that community. Community members could follow via Rss feeds. An OPML file could be provided to subscribe to everyone in the group. The community page could post events and using webmentions, members can rsvp.
- Bulletin board: Maybe? This could work as an aggregator but replies might be difficult to come by. Search might be difficult as well. Could be alleviated by creating an index of the posts and their content. Would need to provide TOS. 
- Q/A: Thinking of something like StackOverflow/Quora where webmentions are the responses people have created on their own sure. Might be cool to use AI for text summarization or even QA based models to extract the answer.
