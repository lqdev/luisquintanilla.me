## Introduction

- What is the indieweb
- How I've adopted the indieweb?
- Businesses want a digital space of their own.
- Principles like owning your data make it easier to have a single source of truth for your business.
  - Microblog. You can create multiple post types (similar to Tumblr).
  - Engage where customers are. They can visit your site, 
  - Customers can follow you wherever they want. No need to create accounts. 

## Own your data

Your content, your metadata, your identity.

## Single source of truth

When you want to get your business on the web, it's possible that you set up a webpage. That could mean you hire a professional developer or you use a platform like WordPress, SquareSpace, Wix, or the website builder provided by your hosting company. 

Once you have your website, you're all done right? 

Not exactly. 

Chances are your webpage is only one of the many digital assets you own. You probably also have Facebook Pages and Yelp. You might claim and add your business to Google and Bing so your business information shows up in search. Many of these services duplicate information and now you have n number of assets to manage and maintain. By owning the domain and having a website for your business, you've already "claimed" it. By making your website your own it means potentially only having one place you need to update for all your information. Business hours, directions, news, events, products, etc. Your site becomes the place customers turn to as the single source of truth to learn about and engage with your business. 

## Communicate with your customers

To communicate with their customers, businesses have to meet them where they are. This often means engaging on the different social media platforms as opposed to their own site. As a result, they have a decision to make when it comes to return on investment. Which platforms will provide me with the highest return (engagement, sales, etc.) on investment (time, money). Choosing a handful might make sense to keep your efforts focused. However, it means you're also excluding potential customers, especially if that platform requires that customers have an account to view your content. 

What could it look like if instead you didn't have to make that choice and your website was also the main place you use to communicate with customers? 

### News, marketing, and events

Businesses use different platforms to share news and announcements regarding their business. They also use these platforms to organize events and market their products. While there are corporate blogs which tend to take on a more professional and polished tone, there's no reason business websites couldn't have microblogs or streams dedicated to sharing more informal materials.  

### Reviews and testimonials

- Using webmentions, customers can own their own content, but also share their thoughts, feedback, and interact with your business from their own websites. 
  - Build a community. People can engage with your business. 
  - Potentially improve veracity of reviews. Amazon product reviews can be questionable. On many occassions I've bought something and usually there are incentives to leave a review in exchange for a discount on other products or the ability to claim products. Bots are also a problem on Amazon. Accepting reviews as webmentions doesn't mean it's unlikely, but it potentially reduces the likelihood. 
  - Businesses can still moderate so not everything ends up on their website. 

## Challenges

- Ease of use. Silos make it easy for you to create content
- Costs. Domain names are relatively cheap. However, depending on the dergee of self-hosting you do, things can start to get expensive. Silos make hosting, or at least a basic version of their offering, free to use.
