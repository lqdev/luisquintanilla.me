      <title>A City on Mars - Can we settle space, should we settle space, and have we really thought this through? by Kelly Weinersmith and Zach Weinersmith</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Earth is not well. The promise of starting life anew somewhere far, far away—no climate change, no war, no Twitter—beckons, and settling the stars finally seems within our grasp. Or is it? Critically acclaimed, bestselling authors Kelly and Zach Weinersmith set out to write the essential guide to a glorious future of space settlements, but after years of research, they aren’t so sure it’s a good idea. Space technologies and space business are progressing fast, but we lack the knowledge needed to have space kids, build space farms, and create space nations in a way that doesn’t spark conflict back home. In a world hurtling toward human expansion into space, A City on Mars investigates whether the dream of new worlds won’t create nightmares, both for settlers and the people they leave behind. In the process, the Weinersmiths answer every question about space you’ve ever wondered about, and many you’ve never considered:  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Can you make babies in space? Should corporations govern space settlements? What about space war? Are we headed for a housing crisis on the Moon’s Peaks of Eternal Light—and what happens if you’re left in the Craters of Eternal Darkness? Why do astronauts love taco sauce? Speaking of meals, what’s the legal status of space cannibalism?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; With deep expertise, a winning sense of humor, and art from the beloved creator of Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, the Weinersmiths investigate perhaps the biggest questions humanity will ever ask itself—whether and how to become multiplanetary.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Get in, we’re going to Mars.

      <title>Agency by William Gibson</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; William Gibson has trained his eye on the future for decades, ever since coining the term “cyberspace” and then popularizing it in his classic speculative novel Neuromancer in the early 1980s. Cory Doctorow raved that The Peripheral is “spectacular, a piece of trenchant, far-future speculation that features all the eyeball kicks of Neuromancer.” Now Gibson is back with Agency—a science fiction thriller heavily influenced by our most current events.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Verity Jane, gifted app whisperer, takes a job as the beta tester for a new product: a digital assistant, accessed through a pair of ordinary-looking glasses. “Eunice,” the disarmingly human AI in the glasses, manifests a face, a fragmentary past, and a canny grasp of combat strategy. Realizing that her cryptic new employers don’t yet know how powerful and valuable Eunice is, Verity instinctively decides that it’s best they don’t.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Meanwhile, a century ahead in London, in a different time line entirely, Wilf Netherton works amid plutocrats and plunderers, survivors of the slow and steady apocalypse known as the jackpot. His boss, the enigmatic Ainsley Lowbeer, can look into alternate pasts and nudge their ultimate directions. Verity and Eunice are her current project. Wilf can see what Verity and Eunice can’t: their own version of the jackpot, just around the corner, and the roles they both may play in it. 

## Review

I really wanted to like this book but didn't. It had a lot of interesting concepts like alternate universes, nuclear apocalypse, autonomous AI, nanotechnology, historical fiction, backroom deals, corporate and government corruption. What's not to like? 

Unfortunately, I never really cared for any of the characters. One of the subplots was the threat of nuclear disaster orchestrated by a terrorist organization. However, at no point did I feel any impending doom throughout the story. The story itself for the most part is uneventful. It wasn't until about three quarters into the book that the story felt like it picked up. There were a few subplots that got going but were dropped. In some instances though, these subplots left the door open to another book which takes place in the timeline a century ahead.  

I was not aware that the first book in this story was The Peripheral. A week before picking up Agency, I started it but couldn't get past the first chapter. I had similar challenges pushing through the first few chapters with Neuromancer as well, which is still a book I want to read. One of the things I find challenging when reading Gibson's books is being thrown straight into a familiar, yet foreign world. I found though from reading Agency, once you push past the first few chapters, things begin to settle down and you can really get into the story. Despite not reading The Peripheral though, I was able to get through Agence no problem. There was enough information given, you could infer and put enough pieces together to make out the references to The Peripheral. Gibson did a great job there. Maybe now that I've read Agency, I can try a similar strategy of pushing past the first few chapters. Given I didn't like Agency, it's not really something I'm looking forward to.

## Notes

In the book, there are references made to Futuro Goth fashion style. Here's what that might look like according to Copilot.

      <title>AHH! That's What I Call Horror: An Anthology of '90s Horror by Chelsea Pumpkins (Editor), S.E. Denton, Bridget D. Brave, Christopher O'Halloran, Caleb Stephens, Edith Lockwood, C.B. Jones, Mathew Wend, P.L. McMillan, Carson Winter, Patrick Barb, J.W. Donley, J.V. Gachs, Damien B.Raphael</title>

## Description

&gt; With fourteen horror stories set during the decade of flannel shirts and neon dolphin Trapper Keepers, Ahh! That's What I Call Horror features a PHAT (pretty horrific and terrifying) collection of totally rad horror and weird fiction authors exploring the darker side of what many consider a time of relative peace and prosperity. With Communism falling and Clear Channel rising, the horror of the 1990s requires peeling back layers of safe, sanitized media to reveal the nightmares waiting beneath. When it comes to '90s horror, this is one anthology guaranteed to be all that and a bag of haunted chips.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; You won't need a dial-up connection to reach the beyond in this time-warp to the '90s. With undead grunge rock icons, menacing action figures, family sitcoms gone very wrong, and more: these terror tales will return you to the end of the old millennium.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; How will you get back?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Like, who says you will?

## Review

A blast from the past. Overall a fun read filled with 90's references. I preferred the first half of the book. *The Grunge* and *Return to Gray Springs: Blockbuster Blues* were my favorite. *Who In The World Is The Hat Man?* was gut-wrenching.

      <title>Armageddon 2419 A.D. by Philip Francis Nowlan</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Nowlan's novella tells about the United States in the 25th century, conquered by Hans in 2109 AD and only now beginning to rebel. Sometime after World War I, nearly all the European powers joined forces against the United States. Although the U.S. won the war, both sides were devastated by the conflict. Taking advantage of the chaos that followed, the "Russian Soviets" (Soviet Union) joined forces with the "Mongolians" to take over Europe. The U.S. collapsed economically and stagnated while the Hans turned against the Russians and defeated them as part of their campaign of world conquest.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; American efforts to avoid war with the Hans failed, and in 2109 AD, the latter attacked the US using fleets of airships armed with disintegrator rays. They attacked from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and down from Canada. After conquering the U.S. and Canada, these "Airlords of Han" ruled North America as a province of the world empire, from 15 great cities they established across the continent. They ignored the Americans, who were left to fend for themselves in the forests and mountains as the Hans' advanced technology prevented the need for slave labor.[1] From time to time, they raid American land "to keep the 'wild' Americans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent their becoming a menace to the Han civilization."  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Living in cooperative gangs and hiding in the forests from the Hans, Americans secretly rebuild their civilization and develop the new technologies "inertron" and "ultron". Inertron is a substance with "reverse weight" (anti-gravitational properties), so that a person carrying an amount of inertron equal to most of his weight (in the form of a "jumper" – "rocket motors encased in inertron blocks and strapped to the back") can travel rapidly across country in long leaps. Ultron, in turn, is an "absolutely invisible and non-reflective solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity, which has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those pulsations known as light, electricity and heat." The Americans use these technologies, as well as explosive rockets and radio frequencies the enemy cannot detect, in their struggle with the Hans.

      <title>Building a Second Brain:A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential by Tiago Forte</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; For the first time in history, we have instantaneous access to the world’s knowledge. There has never been a better time to learn, to contribute, and to improve ourselves. Yet, rather than feeling empowered, we are often left feeling overwhelmed by this constant influx of information. The very knowledge that was supposed to set us free has instead led to the paralyzing stress of believing we’ll never know or remember enough.   
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Now, this eye-opening and accessible guide shows how you can easily create your own personal system for knowledge management, otherwise known as a Second Brain. As a trusted and organized digital repository of your most valued ideas, notes, and creative work synced across all your devices and platforms, a Second Brain gives you the confidence to tackle your most important projects and ambitious goals.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Discover the full potential of your ideas and translate what you know into more powerful, more meaningful improvements in your work and life by Building a Second Brain.  

## Quotes

&gt; ...the value of physical capital in the US-land,machinery, and buildings for example-is about $10 trillion, but that value is dwarfed by the total value of *human* capital, which is estimated to be five to ten times larger. Human capital includes "the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans-their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition (p. 15/202)

&gt; Instantaneous access to the world's knowledge through the Internet was supposed to educate and inform us, but instead it has created a society-wide poverty of attention (p. 18/202)

&gt; Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking (p. 20/202)

&gt; Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solutude before sharing it with others. (p. 21/202)

&gt; A note is a "knowledge building block" - a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head. (p. 22/202)

&gt; ..."heavy lift"-demanding instantaneous results from our brains without the benefit of a support system (p. 32/202)

&gt; ..."slow burn"-allowing bits of thought matter to slowly simmer like a delicious pot of stew brewing on the stove. It is a calmer, more sustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas, instead of all-out binges of manic hustle (p. 32/202)

&gt; When you feel stuck in your creative pursuits, it doesn't mean that theres's something wrong with you. You haven't lost your touch or run out of creative juice. It just means you don't yet have enough raw material to work with. If it feels like the well of inspiration has run dry, it's because you need a deeper well full of examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes-anything that will help you argue your perspective or fight for a cause you believe in (p. 34/202)

&gt; ...*keep only what resonates* in a trusted place that you control, and...leave the rest aside. (p. 39/202)

&gt; The best way to organize your notes is to *organize for action*, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, "How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?" (p. 39/202)

&gt; Information becomes *knowledge*-personal,embodied,verified-only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it's just a theory. (p. 41/202)

&gt; Think of yourself not just as a *taker* of notes, but as a *giver* of notes-you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand. (p.41/202)

&gt; ...personal knowledge management exists to support taking action-anything else is a distraction. (p. 41/202)

&gt; A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the information stream and curate only the best iedas we encouter in a private, trusted place. Think of it as plantnig your own "knowledge garden" where you are free to cultivate your ideas and develop your own thinking away from the deafening noise of other people's opinions. (p. 45/202)

&gt; Feynman revealed his strategy...: *You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, "How did he do it? He must be a genius!"* (p. 51/202)

&gt; Thinking doesn't just produce writing; writing also enriches thinking (p. 62/202)

&gt; Capture isn't about doing more. It's about taking notes on the experiences you're already having (p. 63/202)

&gt; Your Second Brain isn't just a tool-it's an environment. It is a garden of knowledge full of familiar, winding pathways, but also secret and secluded corners. Every pathway is a jumping-off point to new ideas and perspectives. Gardens are natural, but they won't happen by accident. They require a caretaker to seed the plants, trim the weeds, and shape the paths winding through them. (p. 68/202)

&gt; Knowledge is best applied through execution, which means whatever doesn't help you make progress on your projects is probably detracting from them (p. 78/202)

&gt; Instead of organizing ideas according to *where the come from*...[organize] them according to *where they are going*-specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize. (p. 79/202)

&gt; "move quickly and touch lightly"...look for the path of least resistance and make progress in short steps. (p. 83/202)

&gt; "What is the smallest, easiest step I can take that moves me in the right direction?" (p. 83/202)

&gt; If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it *emerges* from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences. (p. 107/202)

&gt; ...Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know. It is about expressing your ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks to test what works and gather feedback from others. That feedback in turn gets drawn in to your Second Brain, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of your work. (p. 108/202) 

&gt; Instead of thinking of your job in terms of *tasks*, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of *assets* and *building blocks* that you can assemble. (p. 122/202)

&gt; To truly "know" something, it's not enough to read about it in a book. Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action. Thoughts are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To tryly make an idea stick, you have to engage with it. (p. 123/202)

&gt; Postponing our goals and desires to "later" often ends up depriving us of the very experiences we need to grow. (p. 136/202)

&gt; Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time. (p. 137/202)

## Notes

- (p. 17/202) Quantified Self community - A network of local meetup groups in which people share their stories about how they track their helth, productivity, mood, or behavior to learn more about themselves. 

- (p. 29/202) Memex (Scholar workstation) - A device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory (Vannevar Bush) 

- (p. 30/202) Four essential capabilities of Second Brain:
  - Making our ideas concrete.
  - Revealing new associations between ideas.
  - Incubating ideas over time
  - Sharpgning unique perspectives 

- (p. 36/202) Three stages of progress:
  - Remembering
  - Connecting
  - Creating

- (p. 37/202) CODE Method:
  - Capture: Keep what resonates
  - Organize: Save for actionability
  - Distill: Find the essence
  - Express: Show your work

- (p. 49/202) Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you're already doing and the life you're already living. 

- (p. 49/202) A knowledge aset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience. Examples include:
  - Highlights: Passages from books / articles your read.
  - Quotes: Memorable passages from podcasts / audiobooks you listen to.
  - Bookmarks / Favorites: Links to content you find on the web or social media.
  - Voice Memos: Clips of recorded "notes to self"
  - Meeting Notes: Notes taken during meetings / calls.
  - Images: Photos or images you find interesting / inspiring.
  - Takeaways: Lessons from courses, conferences, presentations you attended.

- (p. 55/202) Curator's Perspective - We are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives. This means taking charge of your own information stream. The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self spends organizing, distilling, and experessing.

- (p. 55/202) Capture criteria
  - Does it inspire me?
  - Is it useful?
  - Is it personal?
  - Is it surprising? By saving ideas that may contradict each other and don't necessarily support what we already believe, we can train ourselves to take in information from different sources instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. By playing with ideas-bending, stretching, and remixing them-we become less attached to the way they were originally presented and we can borrow certain aspects or elements to use in our own work. 

- (p. 57/202) Metadata capture. It's a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note, such as the original web page address, the title of the piece, the author or publisher, and the date it was published. Also, it's helpful to capture chapter titles, headings, and bullet-point lists, since they add structure to your notes and represent distillation already performed by the author on your behalf.  

- (p. 62/202) Generation Effect - According to research, when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words. 

- (p. 68/202) Cathedral Effect - According to studies, the environment we find ourselves in shapes our thinking. In a space with high ceilings (like a cathedral), we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we're in a room with low ceiling (like a small workshop), we're more likely to think concretely. 

- (p. 70/202) Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives (PARA)
  - Organizes information based on how actionable it is, not what kind of information it is.

- (p. 77/202) ...separate capture and organize into two distinct steps. "Keeping what resonates" in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term. Most notes app have an "inbox" or "daily notes" section where new notes you've captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide whether they belong. 

- (p. 77/202) PARA's four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the decision of where to put your notes as easy as possible:
  - Projects are most actionable because you're working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind.
    - Complete webpage design
    - Create slide deck for conference
    - Plan vacation
    - Find new volunteer opportunity
    - Publish blog post
    - Complete online course
  - Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.
    - Activities or places you are responsible for: Home, Travel
    - People you are responsible for or accountable to: Friends, Spouse
    - Standards of performance you are responsible for: Health, Finances
    - Departments of functions you are responsible for: Marketing, Product Development
    - People or teams you are responsinble for or accountable to: Direct Reports, Manager
    - Standards of performance you are responsible for: Professional development, Relationshipts and networking
  - Resources may become actionable depending on the situation
    - Topics of interest: Beer brewing, architecture
    - Research subjects: Notetaking, Project management, Nutrition
    - Useful reference information: Vacation itineraries, Stock photos, product testimonials
    - Hobbies or passions: Coffee, Classic movies
  - Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.
    - Projects that are completed or cancelled
    - Areas of responsibility you're no longer commited to maintaining
    - Resources that are no longer relevant 

- (p. 78/202) PARA Checklist:
  - In which project will this be most useful?
  - If none: In which area will this be most useful?
  - If none: Which resource does this belong to?
  - If none: Place in archives.

- (p. 109/202) Intermediate Packets - Concrete individual building blocks that make up your work:
  - Set of notes from a team meeting
  - List of relevant research findings
  - Brainstorm with collaborators
  - Slide deck analyzing the market
  - List of action items from a conference call.

- (p. 110/202) Kinds of Intermediate Packets:
  - Distilled Notes - Books / articles you've read and distilled to their essence.
  - Outtakes - Material / ideas that didn't make it into a past project but could be used in future ones. 
  - Work-in-process - Documents, graphics, agendas, plans you produced during a past project
  - Final deliverables - Concrete pieces of work you've delivered as part of past projects. 
  - Documents created by others - knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work. 

- (p. 111/202) Benefits of Intermediate Packets:
  - Become interruption proof because you're focusing only on one small packet at a time.
  - Make progress in any time-span. No need for long uninterrupted time. 
  - Increase quality of your work by collecting feedback more often. 
  - Eventually you'll have so many intermediate packets at your disposal you can execute entire projects by just assembling previously created intermediate packets.

- (p. 104/202) Four retrieval methods:
  - Search: Most useful when you more or less know what you're looking for. 
  - Browsing
  - Tags: Labels that make it easier to see cross-disciplinaery themes and patterns beyond simple categorization.
  - Serendipity

- (p. 130/202) Divergence &amp; Convergence:
  - Divergence - Gathering seeds of imagination and storing them in a secure place
    - Capture
    - Organize
  - Convergence - Shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks assembled
    - Distill
    - Express

- (p.131/202) Strategies for overcoming convergence pitfalls:
  - Give yourself stepping stones (Archipelago of ideas) - Gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. 
    - Reinvention of the old idea of outlining
    - Laying out the points you want to include up front
    - Advantages of digital outlines:
      - More malleable and flexible
      - Can include links to more detailed content
      - Can be Interactive and include multimedia
      - Searchable
      - Accessed and edited from anywhere 
  - Use yesterday's momentum today (Hemmingway Bridge) - End work sessions by establishing starting points for next session.
    - Write down ideas for next steps
    - Write down current status
    - Write down any details you have in mind that are likely forgotten once you step away
    - Write out your intention for the next work session 
    - Send your draft for feedback.
  - Ship something small and concrete (Dial down the scope) -

      <title>Concentration &amp; Inner Awakening: According to Tibetan Buddhism by Fernand Schwarz</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; The practice of concentration is essential so that each of us can freely build our destiny. It allows us to get out of confusion and helps us to better control ourselves. Concentration exercises in daily life facilitate the development of our ability to overcome obstacles without repression or violence in order to obtain a more harmonious daily life. Concentration promotes the reappropriation of our memory and the rediscovery of our true identity.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; This little book invites us to discover in a simple way the itinerary of our consciousness according to the oral teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. This was the goal of the Lama Blo-bzang Don-yod when, in the 17th century to facilitate the learning of his disciples, he made a drawing representing the story of a character accompanied by three symbolic animals on a path.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; This path shows us the difficulties that we must overcome through simple and accessible mental and physical practices that demand very little of our daily time. Indeed, the key to this method is to permanently do a short practice daily rather than long occasional workshops.  

## Review

The book mainly concerns itself with the interpretation of a drawing inspired by an engraving done by Blo-Bzang Don-yod. While the drawing is packed with meaning and ideas, the book felt repetitive and dragged on in some parts. Although it's not a long or hard read at ~50 pages, it feels like it could've been condensed even further into less than 20 pages.

      <title>The Creative Act: A Way of Being by Rick Rubin</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; From the legendary music producer, a master at helping people connect with the wellsprings of their creativity, comes a beautifully crafted book many years in the making that offers that same deep wisdom to all of us.

&gt; Many famed music producers are known for a particular sound that has its day. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a space where artists of all different genres and traditions can home in on who they really are and what they really offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend their self-imposed expectations in order to reconnect with a state of innocence from which the surprising becomes inevitable. Over the years, as he has thought deeply about where creativity comes from and where it doesn’t, he has learned that being an artist isn’t about your specific output, it’s about your relationship to the world. Creativity has a place in everyone’s life, and everyone can make that place larger. In fact, there are few more important responsibilities.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The Creative Act is a beautiful and generous course of study that illuminates the path of the artist as a road we all can follow. It distills the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime’s work into a luminous reading experience that puts the power to create moments—and lifetimes—of exhilaration and transcendence within closer reach for all of us.

## Review

I really enjoyed this book. My favorite sections were the beginning and end of the book. The middle section is good too but it's more about process.

      <title>Desert Oracle: Volume 1 by Ken Layne</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; The cult-y pocket-size field guide to the strange and intriguing secrets of the Mojave—its myths and legends, outcasts and oddballs, flora, fauna, and UFOs—becomes the definitive, oracular book of the desert.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; For the past five years, Desert Oracle has existed as a quasi-mythical, quarterly periodical available to the very determined only by subscription or at the odd desert-town gas station or the occasional hipster boutique, its canary-yellow-covered, forty-four-page issues handed from one curious desert zealot to the next, word spreading faster than the printers could keep up with. It became a radio show, a podcast, a live performance. Now, for the first time—and including both classic and new, never-before-seen revelations—Desert Oracle has been bound between two hard covers and is available to you.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Straight out of Joshua Tree, California, Desert Oracle is “The Voice of the Desert”: a field guide to the strange tales, singing sand dunes, sagebrush trails, artists and aliens, authors and oddballs, ghost towns and modern legends, musicians and mystics, scorpions and saguaros, out there in the sand. Desert Oracle is your companion at a roadside diner, around a campfire, in your tent or cabin (or high-rise apartment or suburban living room) as the wind and the coyotes howl outside at night.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; From journal entries of long-deceased adventurers to stray railroad ad copy, and musings on everything from desert flora, rumored cryptid sightings, and other paranormal phenomena, Ken Layne's Desert Oracle collects the weird and the wonderful of the American Southwest into a single, essential volume.

      <title>The Diaries of Adam and Eve by Mark Twain</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; “The Diaries and Adam and Eve” by Mark Twain was originally published as two separate stories and were later combined at Twain’s request. “Extracts from Adam’s Diary” was published as a stand-alone book in 1904. In 1905, “Eve’s Diary” was published in the Christmas issue of “Harper’s Bazaar” and then as a book in 1906. With his signature wit and charm, Twain tells the separate stories of humanity’s biblical ancestors from the perspective of each in the form of diary entries. As one would expect from one of America’s greatest humorist, Adam and Eve’s diaries are funny and clever interpretations of these classic biblical tales. Adam is portrayed as lazy, cranky, and disinterested in the new, long-haired creature he suddenly finds with him in the Garden of Eden. Eve, in contrast, is enthusiastic, chatty, and brimming with curiosity about the enchanting and abundant life around them. The couple’s children, Cain and Abel, also make a brief appearance, though Adam is characteristically uninterested and Eve is left to the do all the hard work. Twain’s retelling of this classic and ancient myth is touching, funny, and an essential addition to the library of anyone who appreciates one of America’s best storytellers. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper and includes the original illustration of F. Strothmann and Lester Ralph.

## Review

This was a short and fun read. Throughout the beginning of Eve's diary, while in the Garden of Eden, I found myself laughing out loud. After the fall though, Eve's diary takes a more serious tone. At the end of her diary, I felt the sentiments Adam expressed.

Adam's diary had its moments as well and similar to Eve's, the end was touching. 

## Quotes

&gt; ADAM: Wheresoever she was, THERE was Eden.

&gt; [NOTE.—I translated a portion of this diary some years ago, and a friend of mine printed a few copies in an incomplete form, but the public never got them. Since then I have deciphered some more of Adam’s hieroglyphics, and think he has now become sufficiently important as a public character to justify this publication.—M. T.]

&gt; After all these years, I see that I was mistaken about Eve in the beginning; it is better to live outside the Garden with her than inside it without her. At first I thought she talked too much; but now I should be sorry to have that voice fall silent and pass out of my life. Blessed be the chestnut that brought us near together and taught me to know the goodness of her heart and the sweetness of her spirit!]]&gt;</description>

      <title>The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Among the most profound and influential explorations of mind-expanding psychedelic drugs ever written, here are two complete classic books—The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell—in which Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, reveals the mind's remote frontiers and the unmapped areas of human consciousness. This edition also features an additional essay, "Drugs That Shape Men's Minds," now included for the first time.

## Review

The version I read only covered the first part of this essay, The Doors of Perception. A large portion of this book covers Huxley's experiences during altered states of consciousness. The part I found most interesting was his commentary and comparisons between the society of the time's understanding of science, spirituality, and consciousness and those of ancient or native traditions.

## Review

Quick read. I got through it in about two hours. Most of the advice are things that you may have heard of before. Not saying it's bad, but it's more of a reference manual / card. If short on time, you can probably just skip to the conclusion to get a gist of the key points from the book.  

## Quotes

&gt; Unwritten goals lead to confusion, vagueness, misdirection, and numerous mistakes. (p. 34 / 210)

&gt; One of your top goals at work should be to get the highest possible return on your investment of your mental, emotional, and physical energy. (p. 40 / 210)

&gt; Always work from a list. When something new comes up, add it to the list before you do it. (p.41 / 210)

&gt; There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing. (p. 57 / 210)

&gt; The world is full of people who are waiting for someone to come along and motivate them to be the kind of people they wish they could be. The problem is that no one is coming to the rescue. (p. 116 / 210)

&gt; 1. **Set the table:** Decide exactly what you want. Clarity is essential. Write out your goals and objectives before you begin. (p. 164 &amp; 165 / 210)

&gt; 2. **Plan every day in advance:** Think on paper. Every minute you spend on planning can save you five or ten minutes in execution. (p. 165 / 210)

&gt; 4. **Consider the consequences:** Most of your important tasks and priorities are those that can have the most serious consequences, positive or negative, on your life or work. Focus on these above all else. (p. 165 / 210)

&gt; 5. **Practice creative procrastination:** Since you can't do everything, you must learn to deliberately put off those tasks that are too low value os that you have enough time to do the few tihngs that really count. (p. 165 / 210)

&gt; 6. **Use the ABCDE Method continually:** Before you begin work on a list of tasks, take a few moments to organize them by value and priority so you can be sure of working on your most important activiites. (p. 165 / 210)

&gt; 7. **Focus on key result areas:** Identify those results that you absolutely, positively have to get to do your job well, and work on them all day long. (p. 166 / 210)

&gt; 8. **Apply the Law of Three:** Identify the three things you do in your work that account for 90 percent of your contribution, and focus on getting them done before anything else. You will then have more time for your family and personal life. (p. 166 / 210)

&gt; 9. **Prepare thoroughly before you begin:** Hvae everything you need at hand before you start. Assemble all the papers, information, tools, work materials, and numbers you might require so that you can get started and keep going. (p. 166 / 210)

&gt; 10. **Take it one barrel at a time:** You can accomplish the biggest and most complicated job if you just complete it one step at a time. (p. 166 / 210)

&gt; 11. **Upgrade your key skills:** The more knowledgeable and skilled you become as your key tasks, the faster you start them and the sooner you get them done. Determine exactly what it is that you are very good at, and throw your whole heart into doing those specific things very, very well. (p. 166 / 210)

&gt; 12. **Identify your key contraints:** Determine the bottlenecks or choke points, internal or external, that set the speed at which you achieve your most important goals, and focus on alleviating them. (p. 167 / 210)

&gt; 13. **Put the pressure on yourself:** Imagine that you have to leave town for a month, and work as if you had to get your major task completed before you left. (p. 167 / 210)

&gt; 14. **Motivate yourself into action:** Be your own cheerleader. Look for the good in every situation. Focus on the solution rather than the problem. Always be optimistic and constructive. (p. 167 / 210)

&gt; 15. **Technology is a terrible master:** Take back your time from enslaving technological additions. Learn to often turn devices off and leave them off. (p. 167 / 210)

&gt; 17. **Focus your attention:** Stop the interruptions and distractions that interfere with completing your most important tasks. (p. 168 / 210) 

&gt; 18. **Slice and dice the tasks:** Break large, complex tasks down into bite-sized pieces, and then do just one small part of the task to get started. (p. 168 / 210) 

&gt; 19. **Create large chunks of time:** Organize your days around large blocks of time so you can concentrate on extended periods on your most important tasks. (p. 168 / 210)

&gt; 20. **Develop a sense of urgency:** Make a habit of moving fast on your key tasks. Become known as a person who does things quickly and well. (p. 168 / 210)

&gt; 21. **Single handle every task:** Set clear priorities, start immediately on your most important task, and then work without stopping until the job is 100 percent complete. This is the real key to high performance and maximum personal productivity. (p. 168 / 210)

      <title>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution by Steven Levy</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Published in 1984, Hackers is universally acknowledged as the core history of computer culture. Almost forty years after its appearance, readers keep coming to this chronicle of three generations of hacking—hacking in the true, creative sense where brilliant coders create magic with their fingertips. The book introduces the concept of the Hacker Ethic, which depicts a mindset that began at MIT in the 1950s and 1960s, and flourishes to this day as the wizardly of hackers powers the computers so deeply embedded in our lives.

      <title>High Priest by Timothy Leary</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Back in print after 20 years, this text from the earliest days of psychedelia chronicles the experiences on 16 acid trips taken before LSD was illegal. The trip guides or "high priests" included Aldous Huxley, Ram Dass, Ralph Meltzner, Huston Smith and a junkie from New York City named Willy. It tells of the goings-on and freaking out at the Millbrook mansion in New York State that became the Mecca of psychedelia during the 1960s, and of the many luminaries who made their pilgrimage there to trip with Leary and his group. Chapters include an I Ching reading and a chronicle of what happened during those "spacewalks" of the mind.

## Review

I picked this book up (in a town near Woodstock, NY of all places) not knowing what I was in for. I didn't really know much about Leary or his work. The cover and illustrations looked interesting and there were some familiar names like Aldous Huxley and Ram Dass, so that was enough to get me to buy it. This semi-autobiographical book covers a period of time in Leary's life when he had his first psychedelic experience all the way until the time he left / was kicked out of Harvard. During that time, Leary conducted a series of experiments using a variety of psychedelic substances like Psilocybin, LSD, and DMT. As stated in the back cover, each chapter covers a different experience with one of these substances setting the scene for that particular session and then diving into the experience which can be difficult to follow since the writing captures the thoughts during altered states. Some accounts were disturbing. Not exactly what was experienced during the session but events surrounding it (i.e. having one of these sessions early in his experiments at his house while his daughter was hosting a sleepover with her friends). Other accounts were laugh out loud funny. Two different sessions were the most memorable to me. The research program set up at the correctional facility and the other at the church. It was interesting to see his progression at the beginning of the book where he used these substances recreationally and towards the end he appears to develop more reverence or connect spirituality with them. Took me a while to get through the book but overall it was a fun read and first-hand account of this period of time in history. ]]&gt;</description>

      <title>The Holographic Universe: The Revolutionary Theory of Reality by Michael Talbot</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Nearly everyone is familiar with holograms—three-dimensional images projected into space with the aid of a laser. Two of the world's most eminent thinkers believe that the universe itself may be a giant hologram, quite literally a kind of image or construct created, at least in part, by the human mind. University of London physicist David Bohm, a protégé of Einstein and one of the world's most respected quantum physicists, and Stanford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram, an architect of our modern understanding of the brain, have developed a remarkable new way of looking at the universe. Their theory explains not only many of the unsolved puzzles of physics but also such mysterious occurrences as telepathy, out-of-body and near-death experiences, "lucid" dreams, and even religious and mystical experiences such as feelings of cosmic unity and miraculous healings.

## Review

The book starts by using science and the understanding of physics at the time to establish the thesis that the universe is a hologram or simulation. Using this as the foundation, Talbot then explores various natural and supernatural phenomenon such as the placebo effect, stigmata, altered states of consciousness (meditation, hypnosis, lucid dreaming, astral projection, psychedelics), UFOs, near-death-experiences, and uses them as evidence of the latent abilities to shape reality. 

I haven't dived deep into any of the topics and claims made in this book. However, given this book is over 30 years old, personally I'm not aware of shocking new revelations about any of the topics mentioned and they still appear to be in large part considered fringe by the mainstream. Maybe UFOs is one where at the time of this writing there's been hearings at various levels in the U.S. government in recent years. Also, there were reports of UFO / UAV sightings in the New York and New Jersey area over the holidays in 2024.

The truth is out there. I want to believe. 🛸]]&gt;</description>

&gt; When Louise finds out her parents have died, she dreads going home. She doesn’t want to leave her daughter with her ex and fly to Charleston. She doesn’t want to deal with her family home, stuffed to the rafters with the remnants of her father’s academic career and her mother’s lifelong obsession with puppets and dolls. She doesn’t want to learn how to live without the two people who knew and loved her best in the world.

&gt; Most of all, she doesn’t want to deal with her brother, Mark, who never left their hometown, gets fired from one job after another, and resents her success.

&gt; But some houses don’t want to be sold, and their home has other plans for both of them…

      <title>Jung: A Very Short Introduction by Anthony Stevens</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Though he was a prolific writer and original thinker of vast erudition, Jung lacked a gift for clear exposition and his ideas are less widely appreciated than they deserve.   
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In this concise introduction, Anthony Stevens explains clearly the basic concepts of Jungian psychology: the collective unconscious, complex, archetype, shadow, persona, anima, animus, and the individuation of the Self. He examines Jung's views on such disparate subjects as myth, religion, alchemy, 'synchronicity', and the psychology of gender differences, and he devotes separate chapters to the stages of life, Jung's theory of psychological types, the interpretation of dreams, the practice of Jungian analysis, and the unjust allegation that Jung was a Nazi sympathiser. Finally, he argues that Jung's visionary powers and profound spirituality have helped many to find an alternative set of values to the arid materialism prevailing in Western society.

## Review

Anthony Stevens tries to capture Jung's complex work and distill it into less than 200 pages. I found it to be a great insight into Jung's background, life, and main ideas. It also piqued my interest to read other works on specific topics introduced in this book. Before approaching the original source though, I might read analysis of the source instead as an introduction. ]]&gt;</description>

      <title>Lurking: How a Person Became a User by Joanne McNeil</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; One of Esquire’s Best Books to Elevate Your Reading List in 2020, , and a OneZero Best Tech Book of 2020. Named one of the 100 Notable books of 2020 by the End of the World Review.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; A concise but wide-ranging personal history of the internet from—for the first time—the point of view of the user.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In a shockingly short amount of time, the internet has bound people around the world together and torn us apart and changed not just the way we communicate but who we are and who we can be. It has created a new, unprecedented cultural space that we are all a part of—even if we don’t participate, that is how we participate—but by which we’re continually surprised, betrayed, enriched, befuddled. We have churned through platforms and technologies and in turn been churned by them. And yet, the internet is us and always has been.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In Lurking, Joanne McNeil digs deep and identifies the primary (if sometimes contradictory) concerns of people online: searching, safety, privacy, identity, community, anonymity, and visibility. She charts what it is that brought people online and what keeps us here even as the social equations of digital life—what we’re made to trade, knowingly or otherwise, for the benefits of the internet—have shifted radically beneath us. It is a story we are accustomed to hearing as tales of entrepreneurs and visionaries and dynamic and powerful corporations, but there is a more profound, intimate story that hasn’t yet been told.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Long one of the most incisive, ferociously intelligent, and widely respected cultural critics online, McNeil here establishes a singular vision of who we are now, tells the stories of how we became us, and helps us start to figure out what we do now.

      <title>Making It in America - The Almost Impossible Quest to Manufacture in the U.S.A. (And How It Got That Way) by Rachel Slade</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Meet Ben and Whitney Waxman, two tireless idealists attempting to do the impossible: produce an American-made, union-made, all American-sourced sweatshirt—an American hoodie.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Ben spent a decade organizing workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin, fighting for Americans at a time when national support for unions had sunk to an all-time low. Struggling with depression and a drug dependency, Ben lands back in his hometown of Portland, Maine, desperate to prove that ethical manufacturing is possible. There, he meets Whitney, a bartender wrestling with her own complicated past. In each other they see a better future, a version of the American dream they can build together.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Making It in America is a deeply personal account of one couple’s quest to change the world. As they navigate private struggles, international trade wars, and a global pandemic, their story carries us across the nation and across time, from the cotton fields of Mississippi to New York City’s hollowed-out garment district to a family-owned zipper company in Los Angeles to the enormous knit-and-dye factories in North Carolina. Throughout, we grapple with what “Made in the USA” really means to Americans in the twenty-first century.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Making It in America also offers a unique look at global politics, economics, and labor through the story of textile manufacturing. It was the demand for cheap cloth that sparked the industrial revolution. It was the brutality of the textile industry that first drove workers to organize.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Making It in America reveals how profoundly manufacturing shapes all of us. Each twist and turn of the Waxmans’ quest tells us how we got here, where we are now, and where we’re headed—through the people that produce the fabric of our lives.

Excerpt from [Robert F. Kennedy Remarks at University of Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy%27s_remarks_at_the_University_of_Kansas)

&gt; Even if we act to erase material poverty, there is another greater task, it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction - purpose and dignity - that afflicts us all.   
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.   
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.   
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt;  If this is true here at home, so it is true elsewhere in world.

      <title>The Meditative Mind: The Varieties of Meditative Experience by Daniel Goleman</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; The Meditative Mind is an essential traveler’s guide to the topography of the spirit for every spiritual seeker.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; For the beginning meditator, the book provides a comprehensive, accessible overview of the different kinds of meditation, from Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi, Jewish, and Christian to Transcendental, Tantric, Kundalini, Tibeta Buddhist, Zen, and those developed by Gurdjeff and Krishnamurti, and introduces the reader to the basic elements of their practice.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; For the experienced meditator, Goleman explores the distinct levels of consciousness developed as a result of long-term application.  

## Review

This book was a quick and easy read. Given Goleman has an academic background, I enjoyed that the book took that tone. The second part of the book which dives into the various meditation practices using published source material provided a quick introduction into each practice. If you're not interested in learning about the various practices, part three does a nice job summarizing them and essentially getting to the point that in one way or another, for the most part, they're all saying the same thing. The focus of the various practices is on concentration, mindfulness, and insight using meditation as a vehicle. The ultimate goal is using the insights from meditation to effect short and long-term changes in your daily life that get you closer to what is considered ideal. ]]&gt;</description>

      <title>Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World by Paul Stamets</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Mycelium Running is a manual for the mycological rescue of the planet. That’s right: growing more mushrooms may be the best thing we can do to save the environment, and in this groundbreaking text from mushroom expert Paul Stamets, you’ll find out how.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
&gt; The basic science goes like this: Microscopic cells called “mycelium”–the fruit of which are mushrooms–recycle carbon, nitrogen, and other essential elements as they break down plant and animal debris in the creation of rich new soil. What Stamets has discovered is that we can capitalize on mycelium’s digestive power and target it to decompose toxic wastes and pollutants (mycoremediation), catch and reduce silt from streambeds and pathogens from agricultural watersheds (mycofiltration), control insect populations (mycopesticides), and generally enhance the health of our forests and gardens (mycoforestry and myco-gardening).  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In this comprehensive guide, you’ll find chapters detailing each of these four exciting branches of what Stamets has coined “mycorestoration,” as well as chapters on the medicinal and nutritional properties of mushrooms, inoculation methods, log and stump culture, and species selection for various environmental purposes. Heavily referenced and beautifully illustrated, this book is destined to be a classic reference for bemushroomed generations to come.


## Review

Great intro into the intelligence of mushrooms and the different techniques for mycorestoration such as mycopesticides, mycoforestation, mycofiltration, and mycoremediation. Towards the end of the book, Paul presents and index of the most popular species of mushrooms as well as techniques for growing and running your own mycelium.

      <title>Notes From The Undergrond by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Dostoevsky’s most revolutionary novel, Notes from Underground marks the dividing line between nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction, and between the visions of self each century embodied. One of the most remarkable characters in literature, the unnamed narrator is a former official who has defiantly withdrawn into an underground existence. In full retreat from society, he scrawls a passionate, obsessive, self-contradictory narrative that serves as a devastating attack on social utopianism and an assertion of man’s essentially irrational nature.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, whose Dostoevsky translations have become the standard, give us a brilliantly faithful edition of this classic novel, conveying all the tragedy and tormented comedy of the original.

      <title>Palo Alto - A History of California, Capitalism, and the World by Malcom Harris</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; The history of Silicon Valley, from railroads to microchips, is an “extraordinary” story of disruption and destruction, told for the first time in this comprehensive, jaw-dropping narrative (Greg Grandin, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The End of the Myth).  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Palo Alto’s weather is temperate, its people are educated and enterprising, its corporations are spiritually and materially ambitious and demonstrably world-changing. Palo Alto is also a haunted toxic waste dump built on stolen Indian burial grounds, and an integral part of the capitalist world system.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In PALO ALTO, the first comprehensive, global history of Silicon Valley, Malcolm Harris examines how and why Northern California evolved in the particular, consequential way it did, tracing the ideologies, technologies, and policies that have been engineered there over the course of 150 years of Anglo settler colonialism, from IQ tests to the "tragedy of the commons," racial genetics, and "broken windows" theory. The Internet and computers, too. It's a story about how a small American suburb became a powerful engine for economic growth and war, and how it came to lead the world into a surprisingly disastrous 21st century. PALO ALTO is an urgent and visionary history of the way we live now, one that ends with a clear-eyed, radical proposition for how we might begin to change course.

      <title>Simple: Conquering the Crisis of Complexity by Alan Siegel and Irene Etzkorn</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; For decades, Alan Siegel and Irene Etzkorn have championed simplicity as a competitive advantage and a consumer right. Consulting with businesses and organizations around the world to streamline products, services, processes and communications, they have achieved dramatic results.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In Simple, the culmination of their work together, Siegel and Etzkorn show us how having empathy, striving for clarity, and distilling your message can reduce the distance between company and customer, hospital and patient, government and citizen-and increase your bottom line.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Examining the best and worst practices of an array of organizations big and small-including the IRS, Google, Philips, Trader Joe\u2019s, Chubb Insurance, and ING Direct, and many more-Siegel and Etzkorn recast simplicity as a mindset, a design aesthetic, and a writing technique.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; In these illuminating pages you will discover, among other things:  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt;    - Why the Flip camera became roadkill in the wake of the iPhone
&gt;    - What SIMPLE idea allowed the Cleveland Clinic to improve care and increase revenue
&gt;    - How OXO designed a measuring cup that sold a million units in its first 18 months on the market
&gt;    - Where Target got the idea for their \u201cClearRX\u201d prescription system
&gt;    - How New York City simplified its unwieldy bureaucracy with three simple numbers
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; By exposing the overly complex things we encounter every day, SIMPLE reveals the reasons we allow confusion to persist, inspires us to seek clarity, and explores how social media is empowering consumers to demand simplicity.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The next big idea in business is Simple.

      <title>Slow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout by Cal Newport</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Our current definition of “productivity” is broken. It pushes us to treat busyness as a proxy for useful effort, leading to impossibly lengthy task lists and ceaseless meetings. We’re overwhelmed by all we have to do and on the edge of  burnout, left to decide between giving into soul-sapping hustle culture or rejecting ambition altogether. But are these really our only choices?  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Long before the arrival of pinging inboxes and clogged schedules, history’s most creative and impactful philosophers, scientists, artists, and writers mastered the art of producing valuable work with staying power. In this timely and provocative book, Cal Newport harnesses the wisdom of these traditional knowledge workers to radically transform our modern jobs. Drawing from deep research on the habits and mindsets of a varied cast of storied thinkers – from Galileo and Isaac Newton, to Jane Austen and Georgia O’Keefe – Newport lays out the key principles of “slow productivity,” a more sustainable alternative to the aimless overwhelm that defines our current moment. Combining cultural criticism with systematic pragmatism, Newport deconstructs the absurdities inherent in standard notions of productivity, and then provides step-by-step advice for cultivating a slower, more humane alternative.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; From the aggressive rethinking of workload management, to introducing seasonal variation, to shifting your performance toward long-term quality, Slow Productivity provides a roadmap for escaping overload and arriving instead at a more timeless approach to pursuing meaningful accomplishment. The world of work is due for a new revolution. Slow productivity is exactly what we need.

## Review

This was a quick and easy read full of biographies and relevant examples of how people have applied the various principles outlined in the book. If you listen to Cal's podcast, Deep Questions as well as his newsletter and articles, many of the ideas in the book may not be novel. The book is a structured collection of those same ideas. Still a good and enjoyable read though.

      <title>Soul Boom: Why We Need a Spiritual Revolution by Rainn Wilson</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; In this New York Times and Los Angeles Times bestseller, comedic actor, producer, and writer Rainn Wilson explores the problem-solving benefits that spirituality gives us to create solutions for an increasingly challenging world.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; The trauma that our struggling species has experienced in recent years—because of both the pandemic and societal tensions that threaten to overwhelm us—is not going away anytime soon. Existing political and economic systems are not enough to bring the change that the world needs. In this book, Rainn Wilson explores the possibility and hope for a spiritual revolution, a “Soul Boom,” to find a healing transformation on both a personal and global level.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; For Wilson, this is a serious and essential pursuit, but he brings great humor and his own unique perspective to the conversation. He feels that, culturally, we’ve discounted spirituality—faith and the sacred—and we need profound healing and a unifying understanding of the world that the great spiritual traditions provide. Wilson’s approach to spirituality—the non-physical, eternal aspects of ourselves—is relatable and applies to people of all beliefs, even the skeptics. Filled with genuine insight—not to mention enlightening Kung Fu and Star Trek references—Soul Boom delves into ancient wisdom to seek out practical, transformative answers to life’s biggest questions.

## Review

In this book, Rainn explores the impact of society's distancing from the spiritual and religion. Using examples from various world religions and personal annecdotes, he argues that despite the perceived differences, there is a core set of principles they all share. Using these core principles as the foundation, he makes the case for taking the "good parts" and bringing them into your own life as a means of reconnecting with the spiritial and the divine. Ultimately, through this reconnection, not only does it lead to more fulfilling personal experiences and relationships, but also a more conscientious society.]]&gt;</description>

      <title>Ten arguments for deleting your social media accounts right now by Jaron Lanier</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; You might have trouble imagining life without your social media accounts, but virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier insists that we’re better off without them. In Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, Lanier, who participates in no social media, offers powerful and personal reasons for all of us to leave these dangerous online platforms.
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Lanier’s reasons for freeing ourselves from social media’s poisonous grip include its tendency to bring out the worst in us, to make politics terrifying, to trick us with illusions of popularity and success, to twist our relationship with the truth, to disconnect us from other people even as we are more “connected” than ever, to rob us of our free will with relentless targeted ads. How can we remain autonomous in a world where we are under continual surveillance and are constantly being prodded by algorithms run by some of the richest corporations in history that have no way of making money other than being paid to manipulate our behavior? How could the benefits of social media possibly outweigh the catastrophic losses to our personal dignity, happiness, and freedom? Lanier remains a tech optimist, so while demonstrating the evil that rules social media business models today, he also envisions a humanistic setting for social networking that can direct us toward a richer and fuller way of living and connecting with our world.

## Quotes

&gt; Yes, of course it's great that people can be connected, but why must they accept manipulation by a third party as a price of that connection? (p. 65/155)

## Notes

Book to look into - *Beyond Freedom and Dignity, B. F. Skinner*

      <title>The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are by Alan Watts</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; A revelatory primer on what it means to be human, from "the perfect guide for a course correction in life" (Deepak Chopra)—and a mind-opening manual of initiation into the central mystery of existence. At the root of human conflict is our fundamental misunderstanding of who we are. The illusion that we are isolated beings, unconnected to the rest of the universe, has led us to view the “outside” world with hostility, and has fueled our misuse of technology and our violent and hostile subjugation of the natural world. To help us understand that the self is in fact the root and ground of the universe, Watts has crafted a revelatory primer on what it means to be human—and a mind-opening manual of initiation into the central mystery of existence. In  The Book, Alan Watts provides us with a much-needed answer to the problem of personal identity, distilling and adapting the Hindu philosophy of Vedanta. Amazon.com Review Modern Western culture and technology is inextricably tied to the belief in the existence of a self as a separate ego, separated from and in conflict with the rest of the world. In this classic book, Watts provides a lucid and simple presentation of an alternative view based on Hindu and Vedantic philosophy. 

## Review

Short read and great book. I felt in some of the chapters there was some filler, but the conclusions were great.

      <title>The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals About America's Top Secrets by Matthew Connelly</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; Before World War II, transparent government was a proud tradition in the United States. In all but the most serious of circumstances, classification, covert operations, and spying were considered deeply un-American. But after the war, the power to decide what could be kept secret proved too tempting to give up. Since then, we have radically departed from that open tradition, allowing intelligence agencies, black sites, and classified laboratories to grow unchecked. Officials insist that only secrecy can keep us safe, but its true costs have gone unacknowledged for too long.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Using the latest techniques in data science, historian Matthew Connelly analyzes a vast trove of state secrets to unearth not only what the government really did not want us to know but also why they didn’t want us to know it. Culling this research and carefully examining a series of pivotal moments in recent history, from Pearl Harbor to drone warfare, Connelly sheds light on the drivers of state secrecy— especially incompetence and criminality—and how rampant overclassification makes it impossible to protect truly vital information.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; What results is an astonishing study of power: of the greed it enables, of the negligence it protects, and of what we lose as citizens when our leaders cannot be held to account. A crucial examination of the self-defeating nature of secrecy and the dire state of our nation’s archives, The Declassification Engine is a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving the past so that we may secure our future.

      <title>The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation  by Cory Doctorow</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; The platforms locked us into their systems and made us easy pickings, ripe for extraction. Twitter, Facebook and other Big Tech platforms hard to leave by design. They hold hostage the people we love, the communities that matter to us, the audiences and customers we rely on. The impossibility of staying connected to these people after you delete your account has nothing to do with technological limitations: it’s a business strategy in service to commodifying your personal life and relationships.
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; We can – we must – dismantle the tech platforms. In The Internet Con, Cory Doctorow explains how to seize the means of computation, by forcing Silicon Valley to do the thing it fears most: interoperate. Interoperability will tear down the walls between technologies, allowing users leave platforms, remix their media, and reconfigure their devices without corporate permission.
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Interoperability is the only route to the rapid and enduring annihilation of the platforms. The Internet Con is the disassembly manual we need to take back our internet.

## Review

Good book on how user control has been eroding over time resulting in walled gardens and large corporations with monopolistic tendencies. The first parts explore how we got here as well as lay out how adversarial interop may be a solution out of it. The last sections present and break down arguments against interoperability. Overall though it's a team sport that will take users and their representatives working together to take back user soverignty.

      <title>Thrill Switch by Tim Hawking</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; A cyberpunk thriller set in near-future Las Vegas...

&gt; Detective Ada Byron is pumped to be assigned her first murder case–until she sees the crime scene. Someone has been killed exactly the same way as her father was seven years earlier. But, impossibly, he died using VR and the programmer responsible is still in prison. To see if this is a copycat or something more sinister, Ada must confront her father’s killer: the enigmatic Jazlin Switch. What she discovers will change the face of both the real world and the metaverse forever....

## Review

Really fun read. I was able to binge the audiobook in 2 days which is rare for me. While I wouldn't say the general themes covered are original, it still made for a good story. The general book is a cross-over between Blade Runner, Silence of the Lambs, Ready Player One, and House of Cards. I liked the conversations and topics broughout up throughout the book such as:

- What is real?
- The value of privacy and anonimity
- Identity (who / what are you)?

Again, questions that stories like the ones mentioned earlier explore as well. I liked how Tim presented both sides of the argument with scenarios in which characters were presented with situations where they had to consider and sympathize with viewpoints that challenged their stance. ]]&gt;</description>

      <title>Tiny Experiments by Anne-Laure Le Cunff</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; A transformative guide to rethinking our approach to goals, creativity, and life itself from a neuroscientist and entrepreneur, and the creator of the popular Ness Labs newsletter

&gt; Life isn’t linear, and yet we constantly try to mold it around linear goals: four-year college degrees, ten-year career plans, thirty-year mortgages. What if instead we approached life as a giant playground for experimentation? Based on ancestral philosophy and the latest scientific research, Tiny Experiments provides a desperately needed reframing: Uncertainty can be a state of expanded possibility and a space for metamorphosis.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Neuroscientist and entrepreneur Anne-Laure Le Cunff reveals that all you need is an experimental mindset to turn challenges into self-discovery and doubt into opportunity. Readers will replace the old linear model of success with a circular model of growth in which goals are discovered, pursued, and adapted—not in a vacuum, but in conversation with the larger world.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Throughout the book, you will ask hard questions and design simple yet meaningful experiments to find the answers. You will learn how to break free from the invisible cognitive scripts that shape your life, how to harness the power of imperfection, and how to make smarter decisions when the path forward is unclear.  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; This is a guide to:
&gt; - Discover your true ambitions through conducting tiny personal experiments
&gt; - Dismantle harmful beliefs about success that have kept you stuck
&gt; - Dare to make decisions true to your own aspirations
&gt; - Stop trying to find your purpose and start living instead  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Tiny Experiments offers not just practical tools to make sure our most vital work gets done, but a guide to reawakening our curiosity and drive in a noisy, busy, disaffected world, so that we can discover and pursue our most authentic ambitions while making a meaningful contribution.

## Review

I really enjoyed this book and resonated with a lot of points. 

Some of the ones that resonated the most with me include:

- **Outputs, not outcomes** - Focus on the output when setting goals. Create and focus on the now rather than being overwhelmed in trying to control the outcomes. 
- **Metacognition** - Pause and take time to evaluate your thoughts and experiences about what went well, what didn't, and evaluate what the next steps are. 
- **Dance with disruption** - I really enjoyed the parable this chapter started with and puts things into perspective. Our lives and the world are constantly shifting. Rather than trying to control it or label it, surrender and enjoy the ride. 
- **Learning in public** - Let curiosity lead you. You don't have to be an expert. Learning in public frees you up to explore new ideas and also build community along the way. 

I also appreciated Anne-Laure narrating her own book and being honest and vulnerable this was not something she was comfortable with at first. Regardless, I really enjoyed the narration and as an active reader of the blog provided another way to connect with the author. ]]&gt;</description>

## Review

Short and easy read. Good bullet points and tips on writing. The book starts with helping readers identify motivations for why they want to write and provides tips for getting started. Towards the end, it gets deeper into editorial and publishing pratices.

      <title>User Not Found by Felicity Fenton</title>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
## Description

&gt; "Maybe it’s time to unleash my head from the scroll.”  
&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&gt; Prompted by a sequence of discouraging internet encounters, Felicity Fenton attempts to free herself from the tendrils of an online world we know, but struggle to look away from. She evaluates the endless distractions of being tethered to her device and all that comes with it: email, spam, texting, taking pictures, and social media (aka “the walls”). In lyrical prose that swerves into dream-like mirage, hilarious thoughts, social observations, and unwavering sadness, User Not Found is a powerful essay that is all too relatable.  

## Review

Quick read but very personal introspection into relationships with technology and connectedness.
