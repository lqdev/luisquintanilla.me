<h2>Review</h2>
<p>Quick read. I got through it in about two hours. Most of the advice are things that you may have heard of before. Not saying it's bad, but it's more of a reference manual / card. If short on time, you can probably just skip to the conclusion to get a gist of the key points from the book.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Three key capabilities to develop habit of focus and concentration
<ul>
<li>Decision - to develop the habit of task completion</li>
<li>Discipline - yourself to practice the principles learned until they are automatic</li>
<li>Determination - until the habit is locked in and becomes a permanent part of your personality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Think on paper
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Decide what you want</li>
<li>Step 2: Write it down</li>
<li>Step 3: Set a deadline for your goal</li>
<li>Step 4: Make a list of everything you can think of that you are going to have to do to achieve your goal</li>
<li>Step 5: Organize the list into a plan</li>
<li>Step 6: Take action on your plan immediately</li>
<li>Step 7: Resolve to do something every day that moves you toward your major goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Different lists for different purposes
<ul>
<li>Create a master list on which you write down everything you can think of that you want to do sometime in the future</li>
<li>Have a monthly list that you make at the end of the month for the month ahead</li>
<li>Have a weekly list where you plan your entire week in advance</li>
<li>Transfer items fro myour monthly and weekly lists onto your daily list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ABCDE Method
<ul>
<li>A - Something that is very important, something you MUST do. Has serious positive or negative consequences.</li>
<li>B - Something you SHOULD do. Mild consequences.</li>
<li>C - Something that WOULD BE NICE to do. No consequences.</li>
<li>D - Something you can DELEGATE. Delegate anything to free up time for A tasks only YOU can do.</li>
<li>E - Something you can ELIMINATE. Something that may have been important at one time but no longer relevant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On optimist behaviors
<ul>
<li>Look for the good in every situation.</li>
<li>Seek the valuable lesson in every setback or difficulty</li>
<li>Look for the solution to every problem</li>
<li>Think and talk continually about their goals</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On steps to mastery
<ul>
<li>Read in your field for at least one hour every day</li>
<li>Take every course and seminar available</li>
<li>Listen to audio programs in your car</li>
<li>NOTE: I'd add making things to this. You can take all the courses and read all the books, but if you don't put things to practice, mastery is limited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
